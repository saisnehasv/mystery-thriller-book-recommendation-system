That day, Metzengerstein sits staring at an old tapestry depicting a Metzengerstein who kills a Berlifitzing who lies at the feet of his horse. He thinks he sees the horse move and take on ""an energetic and human expression."" A few minutes later, he's told that a new, remarkable ""fiery-colored"" horse has been found in his stables with the letters ""W.V.B."" branded on its forehead, ""I supposed them, of course, to be the initials of William Von Berlifitzing, but all at the castle are positive in denying any knowledge of the horse."",The horse displays ""ferocious and demonlike"" qualities. Only the baron is brave enough to try to break the mysterious horse. Day after day, Metzengerstein rides it as if addicted, and becomes less and less interested in the affairs of his house.

Nights of Awe,"Harri NykÃ¤nen,Kristian London","â€˜NykÃ¤nenâ€™s twist on Nordic crime fiction may be the most inventive of the year. Ariel Kafka, a middle-aged bachelor, is a detective in Helsinki (think early Harry Hole) and, as far as he knows, the only Jew on the entire Helsinki police force, which is why heâ€™s picked to head up the investigation of a series of murders that began with two Arabic-looking men who may have been shouting Jewish obscenities as they died. Set during the days leading up to Yom Kippur, this complex tale moves quickly, as Ari attempts to figure it all out. With pressure from his colleagues, police administration, his brother, and the local Jewish community, can he uncover everything before the holiest day in the Jewish calender? The clever combination of classic Jewish themes with the traditions of Nordic crime makes for a refreshing tale with wide appeal. And the subtle humor, combined with a hero who is not completely depressed and alcoholic, makes it even better. Not just for readers of Nordic fiction, this should also be suggested to those who relate to New York Jewish detectives, including Lenny Briscoe (from Law & Order) and John Munch (from Homicide and Law & Order: SVU), as well as readers who enjoy the black humor of Stuart MacBride.â€™ Booklist,Harri NykÃ¤nen,, born in Helsinki in 1953, was a well-known crime journalist before turning to fiction.

Becoming Evil: How Ordinary People Commit Genocide and Mass Killing,James Waller,"Political or social groups wanting to commit mass murder on the basis of racial, ethnic or religious differences are never hindered by a lack of willing executioners. In ,Becoming Evil,, social psychologist James Waller uncovers the internal and external factors that can lead ordinary people to commit extraordinary acts of evil., Waller debunks the common explanations for genocide- group think, psychopathology, unique cultures- and offers a more sophisticated and comprehensive psychological view of how anyone can potentially participate in heinous crimes against humanity. He outlines the evolutionary forces that shape human nature, the individual dispositions that are more likely to engage in acts of evil, and the context of cruelty in which these extraordinary acts can emerge. Illustrative eyewitness accounts are presented at the end of each chapter. An important new look at how evil develops, ,Becoming Evil, will help us understand such tragedies as the Holocaust and recent terrorist events.

Death Penalty: An American History (Revised),Stuart Banner,"The death penalty arouses our passions as does few other issues. Some view taking another person's life as just and reasonable punishment while others see it as an inhumane and barbaric act. But the intensity of feeling that capital punishment provokes often obscures its long and varied history in this country.,Now, for the first time, we have a comprehensive history of the death penalty in the United States. Law professor Stuart Banner tells the story of how, over four centuries, dramatic changes have taken place in the ways capital punishment has been administered and experienced. In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the penalty was standard for a laundry list of crimes--from adultery to murder, from arson to stealing horses. Hangings were public events, staged before audiences numbering in the thousands, attended by women and men, young and old, black and white alike. Early on, the gruesome spectacle had explicitly religious purposes--an event replete with sermons, confessions, and last minute penitence--to promote the salvation of both the condemned and the crowd. Through the nineteenth century, the execution became desacralized, increasingly secular and private, in response to changing mores. In the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, ironically, as it has become a quiet, sanitary, technological procedure, the death penalty is as divisive as ever.,By recreating what it was like to be the condemned, the executioner, and the spectator, Banner moves beyond the debates, to give us an unprecedented understanding of capital punishment's many meanings. As nearly four thousand inmates are now on death row, and almost one hundred are currently being executed each year, the furious debate is unlikely to diminish. ,The Death Penalty, is invaluable in understanding the American way of the ultimate punishment.",the death penalty arouses our passions as does few other issues some view taking another persons life as just and reasonable punishment while others see it as an inhumane and barbaric act but the intensity of feeling that capital punishment provokes often obscures its long and varied history in this countrynow for the first time we have a comprehensive history of the death penalty in the united states law professor stuart banner tells the story of how over four centuries dramatic changes have taken place in the ways capital punishment has been administered and experienced in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries the penalty was standard for a laundry list of crimesfrom adultery to murder from arson to stealing horses hangings were public events staged before audiences numbering in the thousands attended by women and men young and old black and white alike early on the gruesome spectacle had explicitly religious purposesan event replete with sermons confessions and last minute penitenceto promote the salvation of both the condemned and the crowd through the nineteenth century the execution became desacralized increasingly secular and private in response to changing mores in the twentieth and twentyfirst centuries ironically as it has become a quiet sanitary technological procedure the death penalty is as divisive as everby recreating what it was like to be the condemned the executioner and the spectator banner moves beyond the debates to give us an unprecedented understanding of capital punishments many meanings as nearly four thousand inmates are now on death row and almost one hundred are currently being executed each year the furious debate is unlikely to diminish the death penalty is invaluable in understanding the american way of the ultimate punishment,"['History', 'Nonfiction', 'Law', 'Sociology', 'North American Hi...', 'American History', 'Mystery', 'Crime', 'Politics']",1790,3.92,105,13,674010833

The City That Became Safe: New York's Lessons for Urban Crime and Its Control,Franklin E. Zimring,"The forty-percent drop in crime that occurred across the U.S. from 1991 to 2000 remains largely an unsolved mystery. Even more puzzling is the eighty-percent drop over nineteen years in New York City. Twice as long and twice as large, it is the largest crime decline on record.,In ,The City That Became Safe,, Franklin E. Zimring seeks out the New York difference through a comprehensive investigation into the city's falling crime rates. The usual understanding is that aggressive police created a zero-tolerance law enforcement regime that drove crime rates down. Is this political sound bite true-are the official statistics generated by the police accurate? Though zero-tolerance policing and quality-of-life were never a consistent part of the NYPD's strategy, Zimring shows the numbers are correct and argues that some combination of more cops, new tactics, and new management can take some credit for the decline. That the police can make a difference at all in preventing crime overturns decades of conventional wisdom from criminologists, but Zimring also points out what most experts have missed: the New York experience challenges the basic assumptions driving American crime- and drug-control policies.,New York has shown that crime rates can be greatly reduced without increasing prison populations. New York teaches that targeted harm reduction strategies can drastically cut down on drug related violence even if illegal drug use remains high. And New York has proven that epidemic levels of violent crime are not hard-wired into the populations or cultures of urban America. This careful and penetrating analysis of how the nation's largest city became safe rewrites the playbook on crime and its control for all big cities.",the fortypercent drop in crime that occurred across the us from 1991 to 2000 remains largely an unsolved mystery even more puzzling is the eightypercent drop over nineteen years in new york city twice as long and twice as large it is the largest crime decline on recordin the city that became safe franklin e zimring seeks out the new york difference through a comprehensive investigation into the citys falling crime rates the usual understanding is that aggressive police created a zerotolerance law enforcement regime that drove crime rates down is this political sound bite trueare the official statistics generated by the police accurate though zerotolerance policing and qualityoflife were never a consistent part of the nypds strategy zimring shows the numbers are correct and argues that some combination of more cops new tactics and new management can take some credit for the decline that the police can make a difference at all in preventing crime overturns decades of conventional wisdom from criminologists but zimring also points out what most experts have missed the new york experience challenges the basic assumptions driving american crime and drugcontrol policiesnew york has shown that crime rates can be greatly reduced without increasing prison populations new york teaches that targeted harm reduction strategies can drastically cut down on drug related violence even if illegal drug use remains high and new york has proven that epidemic levels of violent crime are not hardwired into the populations or cultures of urban america this careful and penetrating analysis of how the nations largest city became safe rewrites the playbook on crime and its control for all big cities,"['Nonfiction', 'Sociology', 'History', 'Mystery', 'Crime', 'Politics', 'Government', 'Science', 'Academic', 'School', 'Crime', 'True Crime', 'Culture', 'Society', 'Cities', 'Urbanism']",1701,3.6,77,13,199844429

Murdered (KindleSingle),Paul Alexander,"LA Police Officer Stephanie Lazarus became the center of national attention in a sensational trial in Los Angeles in March 2012 as the accused murderer of Sherri Rasmussen, her ex-lover's new wife of only three months. What had once seemed unthinkable, had suddenly become a reality. Nels Rasmussen, the victim's father, had, some twenty years prior, pleaded with LAPD to take a look at Lazarus as a possible suspect. His daughter had said that Lazarus had been ""stalking"" her, but Rasmussen was summarily dismissed by police and told that he should ""Stop watching so much television."" After five years, he simply gave up.,The story here begins on the night of February 24, 1986 and involves three people, certainly one of them innocent; the victim--Sherri Rae Rasmussen--was bludgeoned, bitten, beaten, and then shot to death in what was made to look like a botched robbery. Yet the only thing missing from the scene was a marriage certificate.,In 2009, the Cold Case squad in the same building as Officer Lazarus re-opened the Rasmussen case and examined the DNA swabbing from the bite-marks on Rasmussenâ€™s arm. They discovered that the saliva could only have come from a woman. Then, they started to investigate Lazarus based on Rasmussenâ€™s suspicions on record in the file.,This is a book that one wishes were fiction. It is written point-of-fact, with all of the details of the case laid out neatly before the reader in police procedural style. The reader becomes the jury.

The Shark Net,Robert Drewe,"Aged six, Robert Drewe moved with his family from Melbourne to Perth, the world's most isolated city - and proud of it. This sun-baked coast was innocently proud, too, of its tranquillity and friendliness. Then a man he knew murdered a boy he also knew. The murderer randomly killed eight strangers - variously shooting, strangling, stabbing, bludgeoning and hacking his victims and running them down with cars - an innocent Perth was changed forever. In the middle-class suburbs which were the killer's main stalking grounds, the mysterious murders created widespread anxiety and instant local myth. 'The murders and their aftermath have both intrigued me and weighed heavily on me for three decades. To try to make sense of this time and place, and of my own childhood and adolescence, I had, finally, to write about it.' The result is 'The Shark Net', a vibrant and haunting memoir that reaches beyond the dark recesses of murder and chaos to encompass their ordinary suburban backdrop.",aged six robert drewe moved with his family from melbourne to perth the worlds most isolated city and proud of it this sunbaked coast was innocently proud too of its tranquillity and friendliness then a man he knew murdered a boy he also knew the murderer randomly killed eight strangers variously shooting strangling stabbing bludgeoning and hacking his victims and running them down with cars an innocent perth was changed forever in the middleclass suburbs which were the killers main stalking grounds the mysterious murders created widespread anxiety and instant local myth the murders and their aftermath have both intrigued me and weighed heavily on me for three decades to try to make sense of this time and place and of my own childhood and adolescence i had finally to write about it the result is the shark net a vibrant and haunting memoir that reaches beyond the dark recesses of murder and chaos to encompass their ordinary suburban backdrop,"['Nonfiction', 'Autobiography', 'Memoir', 'Biography', 'Cultural', 'Australia', 'Crime', 'True Crime', 'Mystery', 'Crime', 'Biography', 'Autobiography', 'History', 'Academic', 'School', 'Academic', 'Read For School']",954,3.67,1434,102,143002155

"The Feud: The Hatfields and McCoys, The True Story",Dean King,"For more than a century, the enduring feud between the Hatfields and the McCoys has been American shorthand for passionate, unyielding, and even violent confrontation. Yet despite numerous articles, books, television shows, and feature films, nobody has ever told the in-depth ,true, story of this legendarily fierce-and far-reaching-clash in the heart of Appalachia. Drawing upon years of original research, including the discovery of previously lost and ignored documents and interviews with relatives of both families, bestselling author Dean King finally gives us the full, unvarnished tale, one vastly more enthralling than the myth.,Unlike previous accounts, King's begins in the mid-nineteenth century, when the Hatfields and McCoys lived side-by-side in relative harmony. Theirs was a hardscrabble life of farming and hunting, timbering and moonshining-and raising large and boisterous families-in the rugged hollows and hills of Virginia and Kentucky. Cut off from much of the outside world, these descendants of Scots-Irish and English pioneers spoke a language many Americans would find hard to understand. Yet contrary to popular belief, the Hatfields and McCoys were established and influential landowners who had intermarried and worked together for decades.,When the Civil War came, and the outside world crashed into their lives, family members were forced to choose sides. After the war, the lines that had been drawn remained-and the violence not only lived on but became personal. By the time the fury finally subsided, a dozen family members would be in the grave. The hostilities grew to be a national spectacle, and the cycle of killing, kidnapping, stalking by bounty hunters, and skirmishing between governors spawned a legal battle that went all the way to the United States Supreme Court and still influences us today.,Filled with bitter quarrels, reckless affairs, treacherous betrayals, relentless mercenaries, and courageous detectives, THE FEUD, ,is the riveting story of two frontier families struggling for survival within the narrow confines of an unforgiving land.

"Bootleg: Murder, Moonshine, and the Lawless Years of Prohibition",Karen Blumenthal,"
  ,
    ,It began with the best of intentions. Worried about the effects of alcohol on American families, mothers and civic leaders started a movement to outlaw drinking in public places. Over time, their protests, petitions, and activism paid offâ€”when a Constitional Amendment banning the sale and consumption of alcohol was ratified, it was hailed as the end of public drunkenness, alcoholism, and a host of other social ills related to booze. Instead, itÂ began a decade of lawlessness, when children smuggled (and drank) illegal alcohol, the most upright citizens casually broke the law, and a host of notorious gangsters entered the public eye. Filled with period art and photographs, anecdotes, and portraits of unique characters from the era, this fascinating book looks at the rise and fall of the disastrous social experiment known as Prohibition. ,

This secret, which Rhyme is convinced will provide the key to why Geneva is in danger, revolves around some mysterious doings in the area known as Gallows Heights, a neighborhood on the Upper West Side of Manhattan that in the 1860s was a tense mix of wealthy financiers, civil rights leaders, political crooks like Boss Tweed, and working-class laborers and thugs. What was the truth behind the crime Charles was accused of? And what was his secret? Does it have to do with stolen gold? Or does it have a far broader implications?,Other complications keep the pot boiling: Rhyme is struggling through extensive therapy; will it have any effect on his quadriplegic conditions? And fiercely independent Geneva Settle battles both the killers and her protectors to maintain order in her life so that she can escape from Harlem to college and Europe as soon as possible.,Page Numbers Source ISBN: 0340960620",a highschool girl in harlem geneva settle is the target of a ruthless professional killerthompson boydwho has been hired to murder her for reasons unknown his first attempt in a deserted museum early one morning is a failure but its clear to lincoln rhyme that hes going to strike again from clues the killer leaves behind one of which is the twelfth card in the tarot deck the hanged man whose meaning resonates eerily throughout the storyassisted by fred dellray mel cooper and lon sellitto suffering from a severe case of shattered nerves due to a near miss by the killer rhyme and partner amelia sachs work frantically to learn who the hit man and his partner are and when they will strike next all the while trying to crack a very cold case rhyme believes that geneva may have been targeted because of a paper shes writing about her ancestor charles singleton a former slave who was instrumental in the civil rights movement in the 1860s but who was arrested for theft and disgracedin his correspondence charles wrote about a secret that could have tragic consequences if revealed this secret which rhyme is convinced will provide the key to why geneva is in danger revolves around some mysterious doings in the area known as gallows heights a neighborhood on the upper west side of manhattan that in the 1860s was a tense mix of wealthy financiers civil rights leaders political crooks like boss tweed and workingclass laborers and thugs what was the truth behind the crime charles was accused of and what was his secret does it have to do with stolen gold or does it have a far broader implicationsother complications keep the pot boiling rhyme is struggling through extensive therapy will it have any effect on his quadriplegic conditions and fiercely independent geneva settle battles both the killers and her protectors to maintain order in her life so that she can escape from harlem to college and europe as soon as possiblepage numbers source isbn 0340960620,"['Mystery', 'Thriller', 'Fiction', 'Mystery', 'Crime', 'Thriller', 'Mystery Thriller', 'Suspense', 'Mystery', 'Detective', 'Audiobook', 'Adult', 'Mystery', 'Murder Mystery']",1971,3.99,16049,691,739455834

"Going Clear: Scientology, Hollywood, and the Prison of Belief",Lawrence Wright,"A clear-sighted revelation, a deep penetration into the world of Scientology by the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of the now-classic study of al-Qaeda's 9/11 attack, ,the Looming Tower,. Based on more than two hundred personal interviews with both current and former Scientologists--both famous and less well known--and years of archival research, Lawrence Wright uses his extraordinary investigative skills to uncover for us the inner workings of the Church of Scientology: its origins in the imagination of science-fiction writer L. Ron Hubbard; its struggles to find acceptance as a legitimate (and legally acknowledged) religion; its vast, secret campaign to infiltrate the U.S. government; and its dramatic efforts to grow and prevail after the death of Hubbard.,At the book's center, two men whom Wright brings vividly to life, showing how they have made Scientology what it is today: The darkly brilliant L. Ron Hubbard--whose restless, expansive mind invented a new religion tailor-made to prosper in the spiritually troubled post-World War II era. And his successor, David Miscavige--tough and driven, with the unenviable task of preserving the church in the face of ongoing scandals and continual legal assaults.,We learn about Scientology's esoteric cosmology; about the auditing process that determines an inductee's state of being; about the Bridge to Total Freedom, through which members gain eternal life. We see the ways in which the church pursues celebrities, such as Tom Cruise and John Travolta, and how young idealists who joined the Sea Org, the church's clergy, whose members often enter as children, signing up with a billion-year contract and working with little pay in poor conditions. We meet men and women ""disconnected"" from friends and family by the church's policy of shunning critical voices. And we discover, through many firsthand stories, the violence that has long permeated the inner sanctum of the church.,In ,Going Clear,, Wright examines what fundamentally makes a religion a religion, and whether Scientology is, in fact, deserving of the constitutional protections achieved in its victory over the IRS. Employing all his exceptional journalistic skills of observations, understanding, and synthesis, and his ability to shape a story into a compelling narrative, Lawrence Wright has given us an evenhanded yet keenly incisive book that goes far beyond an immediate exposÃ© and uncovers the very essence of what makes Scientology the institution it is.",a clearsighted revelation a deep penetration into the world of scientology by the pulitzer prizewinning author of the nowclassic study of alqaedas 911 attack the looming tower based on more than two hundred personal interviews with both current and former scientologistsboth famous and less well knownand years of archival research lawrence wright uses his extraordinary investigative skills to uncover for us the inner workings of the church of scientology its origins in the imagination of sciencefiction writer l ron hubbard its struggles to find acceptance as a legitimate and legally acknowledged religion its vast secret campaign to infiltrate the us government and its dramatic efforts to grow and prevail after the death of hubbardat the books center two men whom wright brings vividly to life showing how they have made scientology what it is today the darkly brilliant l ron hubbardwhose restless expansive mind invented a new religion tailormade to prosper in the spiritually troubled postworld war ii era and his successor david miscavigetough and driven with the unenviable task of preserving the church in the face of ongoing scandals and continual legal assaultswe learn about scientologys esoteric cosmology about the auditing process that determines an inductees state of being about the bridge to total freedom through which members gain eternal life we see the ways in which the church pursues celebrities such as tom cruise and john travolta and how young idealists who joined the sea org the churchs clergy whose members often enter as children signing up with a billionyear contract and working with little pay in poor conditions we meet men and women disconnected from friends and family by the churchs policy of shunning critical voices and we discover through many firsthand stories the violence that has long permeated the inner sanctum of the churchin going clear wright examines what fundamentally makes a religion a religion and whether scientology is in fact deserving of the constitutional protections achieved in its victory over the irs employing all his exceptional journalistic skills of observations understanding and synthesis and his ability to shape a story into a compelling narrative lawrence wright has given us an evenhanded yet keenly incisive book that goes far beyond an immediate expos and uncovers the very essence of what makes scientology the institution it is,"['Nonfiction', 'Religion', 'History', 'Audiobook', 'Religion', 'Cults', 'Biography', 'Psychology', 'Writing', 'Journalism', 'Crime', 'True Crime', 'Sociology']",2410,4.03,40473,4463,307700666

And certainly not Bobbie Crocker, the elderly man with a history of mental illness whom Laurel comes to know through her work at a Burlington homeless shelter in the years subsequent to the attack.,In his moments of lucidity, the gentle, likable Bobbie alludes to his earlier life as a successful photographer.

How could such an accomplished man have fallen on such hard times? Becoming obsessed with uncovering Bobbie's past, Laurel studies his photographs, tracking down every lead they provide into the mystery of his life before homelessness -- including links to the rich neighborhoods of her own Long Island childhood and to the earlier world of F.

The case attracted national media attention. ""Shattered Innocence"" is the previously untold story of the Jaycee Lee Dugard abduction. Seeking to set the record straight, it examines the case that stunned the nation first in 1991 when 11-year-old Jaycee was kidnapped, and then again nearly 20 years later, when her captors were finally arrested so she could go free.

El Sicario: The Autobiography of a Mexican Assassin,"Molly Molloy,Charles Bowden","In this unprecedented and chilling monologue, a repentant Mexican hitman tells the unvarnished truth about the war on drugs on the American. El Sicario is the hidden face of America's war on drugs. He is a contract killer who functioned as a commandante in the Chihuahuan State police, who was trained in the US by the FBI, and who for twenty years kidnapped, tortured and murdered people for the drug industry at the behest of Mexican drug cartels. He is a hit man who came off the killing fields alive. He left the business and turned to Christ. And then he decided to tell the story of his life and work. Charles Bowden first encountered El Sicario while reporting for the book ""Murder City"". As trust between the two men developed, Bowden bore witness to the Sicario's unfolding confession, and decided to tell his story. The well-spoken man that emerges from the pages of ,El Sicario, is one who has been groomed by poverty and driven by a refusal to be one more statistic in the failure of Mexico. He is not boastful, he claims no major standing in organized crime. But he can explain in detail not only torture and murder, but how power is distributed and used in the arrangement between the public Mexican state and law enforcement on the ground - where terror and slaughter are simply tools in implementing policy for both the police and the cartels. And he is not an outlaw or a rebel. He is the state. When he headed the state police anti-kidnapping squad in Juarez, he was also running a kidnapping ring in Juarez. When he was killing people for money in Juarez, he was sharpening his marksmanship at the Federal Police range. Now he lives in the United States as a fugitive. One cartel has a quarter million dollar contract on his head. Another cartel is trying to recruit him. He speaks as a free man and of his own free will - there are no charges against him. He is a lonely voice - no one with his background has ever come forward and talked. He is the future - there are thousands of men like him in Mexico and there will be more in other places.

The Anatomy of Violence: The Biological Roots of Crime,Adrian Raine,"With a 4-page full-color insert, and black-and-white illustrations throughout,Why do some innocent kids grow up to become cold-blooded serial killers? Is bad biology partly to blame? For more than three decades Adrian Raine has been researching the biological roots of violence and establishing neurocriminology, a new field that applies neuroscience techniques to investigate the causes and cures of crime. In, The Anatomy of Violence,, Raine dissects the criminal mind with a fascinating, readable, and far-reaching scientific journey into the body of evidence that reveals the brain to be a key culprit in crime causation. ,Â ,Raine documents from genetic research that the seeds of sin are sown early in life, giving rise to abnormal physiological functioning that cultivates crime. Drawing on classical case studies of well-known killers in historyâ€”including Richard Speck, Ted Kaczynski, and Henry Lee Lucasâ€”Raine illustrates how impairments to brain areas controlling our ability to experience fear, make good decisions, and feel guilt predispose us to violence. He contends that killers can actually be coldhearted: something as simple as a low resting heart rate can give rise to violence. But arguing that biology is not destiny, he also sketches out provocative new biosocial treatment approaches that can change the brain and prevent violence. ,Â ,Finally, Raine tackles the thorny legal and ethical dilemmas posed by his research, visualizing a futuristic brave new world where our increasing ability to identify violent offenders early in life might shape crime-prevention policies, for good and bad.

Seduced by Madness: The True Story of the Susan Polk Murder Case,Carol Pogash,"She was fifteen when she visited the therapist; still a teen when they had sex. She was twenty-five when she married him and forty-four when she killed him.,In October 2002, the quiet northern California town of Orinda was rocked by murder when Susan Polk, the mother of three teenage boys, was arrested for stabbing her husband and former therapist, Dr. Felix Polk, to death. The arrest and subsequent trial quickly became one of the most talked about murder cases in the country, as spectators and reporters learned the strange history behind this shocking killing.,Now in ,Seduced by Madness,, Carol Pogashâ€”the leading journalist working the caseâ€”has written the definitive account of the Polk family saga, offering a rich and textured re-creation of this disturbing and tragic American tale. Examining the decadent culture of California in the 1970s, Pogash looks at how, in this period of drugs and sexual exploration, a fifteen-year-old Susan found herself caught in the grasp of Felix, her therapistâ€”who, like others in the mental health profession, fell for every passing trend in mental health therapy. Culled from years of careful research, Pogash reconstructs the vague beginnings of the couple's sexual relationship in the therapist's office, exploring how Felix's relaxed attitude toward therapy blinded him to the complex nature of Susan's mental state, and how their mutual obsession with each other sealed their fate.,With lyrical prose, Pogash skillfully traces the Polks' storyâ€”from their early yearnings for one another through their flawed marriage, which produced three highly intelligent but emotionally divided sons. Weaving a complex narrative of a family who lived in multimillion dollar homes but lingered in the shadow of dysfunction, Pogash reassembles their life in the years and months before Felix's death, intimately describing what led this soft-spoken wife to murder.,Three years after Felix's death, Susan Polk was tried for first degree murder, and here Pogash provides a first-hand account of the wild, media-circus trial in which Susan defended herself and cross-examined two of her sons. Illustrating how the prosecution and the court responded to Susan's volatile behavior, Pogash takes you inside the deliberation room and uncovers how jurors reached their surprising verdict.,Filled with the most complete case facts and interviews available, ,Seduced by Madness, offers an unparalleled look at one of the most captivating murder cases in recent years.",she was fifteen when she visited the therapist still a teen when they had sex she was twentyfive when she married him and fortyfour when she killed himin october 2002 the quiet northern california town of orinda was rocked by murder when susan polk the mother of three teenage boys was arrested for stabbing her husband and former therapist dr felix polk to death the arrest and subsequent trial quickly became one of the most talked about murder cases in the country as spectators and reporters learned the strange history behind this shocking killingnow in seduced by madness carol pogashthe leading journalist working the casehas written the definitive account of the polk family saga offering a rich and textured recreation of this disturbing and tragic american tale examining the decadent culture of california in the 1970s pogash looks at how in this period of drugs and sexual exploration a fifteenyearold susan found herself caught in the grasp of felix her therapistwho like others in the mental health profession fell for every passing trend in mental health therapy culled from years of careful research pogash reconstructs the vague beginnings of the couples sexual relationship in the therapists office exploring how felixs relaxed attitude toward therapy blinded him to the complex nature of susans mental state and how their mutual obsession with each other sealed their fatewith lyrical prose pogash skillfully traces the polks storyfrom their early yearnings for one another through their flawed marriage which produced three highly intelligent but emotionally divided sons weaving a complex narrative of a family who lived in multimillion dollar homes but lingered in the shadow of dysfunction pogash reassembles their life in the years and months before felixs death intimately describing what led this softspoken wife to murderthree years after felixs death susan polk was tried for first degree murder and here pogash provides a firsthand account of the wild mediacircus trial in which susan defended herself and crossexamined two of her sons illustrating how the prosecution and the court responded to susans volatile behavior pogash takes you inside the deliberation room and uncovers how jurors reached their surprising verdictfilled with the most complete case facts and interviews available seduced by madness offers an unparalleled look at one of the most captivating murder cases in recent years,"['Crime', 'True Crime', 'Nonfiction', 'Mystery', 'Crime']",2424,3.72,664,68,61147702

David Goodis: Five Noir Novels of the 1940s & 50s,"David Goodis,Robert Polito","Among the pantheon of American crime writersâ€”those masters of noir whose powerful vernacular style and dark and subversive themes transformed American culture and writingâ€”David Goodis was a unique figure. Born in Philadelphia, he brought a jazzy, expressionist style and an almost hallucinatory intensity to his spare, passionate, uncompromising novels of mean streets and doomed people. Though little acknowledged during his lifetime, he has long enjoyed an international cult following, and his works have been adapted for the screen by directors including FranÃ§ois Truffaut, Samuel Fuller, Jean-Jacques Beineix, and Jacques Tourneur.,Now, for the first time, his best work is collected in a single volume. Goodis experienced a brief celebrity when his novel ,Dark Passage, (1946) became the basis for a popular movie starring Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall. The story of a man railroaded for his wifeâ€™s murder and forced to assume a different identity after escaping from prison becomes in Goodisâ€™s hands a lyrical evocation of urban fear and loneliness. ,Nightfall, (1947) further develops the theme of the innocent pursued, as artist Jim Vanning becomes accidentally embroiled in a violent robbery and must evade criminals and police alike.,In ,The Burglar, (1953), first published like all his later novels as a paperback original, Goodis explores his characteristic notion of the criminal gang as surrogate family, wracked by thwarted aspirations and contradictory desires. The bookâ€™s reluctant criminal hero might be taken as a self-portrait of Goodis himself: â€œThe way he operated was quiet and slow, very slow â€¦ always artistic without knowing or interested in knowing that it was artistic, always accurate with it and always extremely unhappy with it.â€,The Moon in the Gutter, (1953) is one of Goodisâ€™s many tours of the down-and-out neighborhoods of his native city. William Kerriganâ€™s pursuit of the riddle of his sisterâ€™s death in an obscure alleyway provides the starting point for a tortuous journey into â€œthe darkness of all lost dreams.â€ In ,Street of No Return, (1954), another skid row odyssey, a famous crooner scarred by violence descends into dereliction. From its opening in the freezing wind of a November street corner through its explosive ending, it is imbued with Goodisâ€™s deep identification with â€œthe unchartered society of the homeless and the hopeless.â€",among the pantheon of american crime writersthose masters of noir whose powerful vernacular style and dark and subversive themes transformed american culture and writingdavid goodis was a unique figure born in philadelphia he brought a jazzy expressionist style and an almost hallucinatory intensity to his spare passionate uncompromising novels of mean streets and doomed people though little acknowledged during his lifetime he has long enjoyed an international cult following and his works have been adapted for the screen by directors including franois truffaut samuel fuller jeanjacques beineix and jacques tourneurnow for the first time his best work is collected in a single volume goodis experienced a brief celebrity when his novel dark passage 1946 became the basis for a popular movie starring humphrey bogart and lauren bacall the story of a man railroaded for his wifes murder and forced to assume a different identity after escaping from prison becomes in goodiss hands a lyrical evocation of urban fear and loneliness nightfall 1947 further develops the theme of the innocent pursued as artist jim vanning becomes accidentally embroiled in a violent robbery and must evade criminals and police alikein the burglar 1953 first published like all his later novels as a paperback original goodis explores his characteristic notion of the criminal gang as surrogate family wracked by thwarted aspirations and contradictory desires the books reluctant criminal hero might be taken as a selfportrait of goodis himself the way he operated was quiet and slow very slow always artistic without knowing or interested in knowing that it was artistic always accurate with it and always extremely unhappy with itthe moon in the gutter 1953 is one of goodiss many tours of the downandout neighborhoods of his native city william kerrigans pursuit of the riddle of his sisters death in an obscure alleyway provides the starting point for a tortuous journey into the darkness of all lost dreams in street of no return 1954 another skid row odyssey a famous crooner scarred by violence descends into dereliction from its opening in the freezing wind of a november street corner through its explosive ending it is imbued with goodiss deep identification with the unchartered society of the homeless and the hopeless,"['Fiction', 'Mystery', 'Noir', 'Mystery', 'Crime', 'Mystery', 'Thriller', 'Classics', 'Pulp', 'Thriller', 'Mystery Thriller', 'Literature', 'Literature', 'American']",2311,4.33,240,44,1598531484

Windows,Billy London,"Don't touch the hot Italian was a mantra Gina Robinson had spent the last ten years repeating to herself about her best friend, Nick Da Canaveze. She had to repeat it often, as Nick was hot beyond all reason. With a crazy-built body, a wicked sense of humour, and brains, he was the kind of man who could bring a woman pleasure with little more than a sideways glance. She had to give herself a slap on the wrist whenever she caught herself looking. And she looked...a lot. ,Looking at Nick made her eyes feel good; being with Nick made her feel good. And she needed to feel good considering the state of her life. Her father had recently passed away, she was drowning in debt, and she was being hounded for money at every turn. It wasnâ€™t the creditors who had her worried...it was those other guys. Deep down, she knew Nick could make everything better, but she wasnâ€™t going to ruin their friendship. She really wanted to...but she couldn't. While she might playfully call him â€œSoprano,â€ Nick was her sweet dude. She could look...and fantasize...and drool discreetly, but she must not touch. ,Everyone knew how Nick felt about Gina. Everyone except for Gina. Ten years was a long time to wait for the girl you love to get a clue, especially when it only took him a month to realise he wanted to worship at the altar of her body every day for the rest of his life. Heâ€™d dated other women, but all along heâ€™d known Gina was the one for him. Gina wasnâ€™t just good for him, she was perfect for him. She met all the requirements for the sort of woman his family would approve of: a) she could cook Italian better than his mother (donâ€™t tell his mother) and b) she spoke Italian beautifully. The only problem was c) she wasnâ€™t a nice Italian girl who would walk ten paces behind him, do everything he commanded and ask no questions. He knew C wasnâ€™t going to happen in this lifetime, and he wouldnâ€™t have it any other way.,All she needed to do was meet his own two requirements: love sex and love him. While he wasnâ€™t sure if she loved sex, heâ€™d spent many nights imagining just how much she could do. Did her beautiful chocolate skin taste as good as it looked? Would she moan his name or scream it when he brought her to climax? ,Best friends for a decade, they shared everything...except what his family really did for a living. Impatient at the best of times, Nick kept telling himself to wait for the right time to reveal the truth. Then an incident that put Gina in real danger made him realise he was done waiting around. It also made him admit what everyone else already knew: Gina was unequivocally his. No one else was going to sweep in and take what belonged to him. Da Canavezes never let anyone take from them, and only those who wanted to meet God sooner rather than later attempted such a thing. ,Once he got around the whole Hi, Soprano!, Bye, Soprano!, Can you make me a cup of tea, Soprano? platonic-friendship nonsense that had up to now categorized their relationship, Nick vowed to get around to teaching her new phrases like Harder, Soprano!, Deeper, Soprano!, You're going to make me break the sound barrier when I scream out your name, Soprano! ,Knowing just how independent Gina was, he decided heâ€™d give her space to accept that being Mrs. Da Canaveze was what the future held. Of course, heâ€™d keep giving her his intense lovemaking until heâ€™d convinced her. After heâ€™d â€œconvincedâ€ her, maybe then he'd mention what he and his family really did for a living. It might make a difference with everyone else, but he wouldn't let Gina use that to keep him away from her. He would explain it. She would definitely yell. He would put his foot down. She was his. End of story. And then all hell broke loose in the guise of his mother. ,Nick finally found his hands full. He had a woman to try to keep hold of, an overbearing mother to calm down, and â€œbusinessâ€ to deal with. Gina might see the Da Canaveze name simply as the surname that would soon be hers, but that name was whispered with respect. Gina might think of him as her â€œdudeâ€ but those whoâ€™d crossed him populated more than a few unmarked graves. And heâ€™d already reserved one for the man whoâ€™d dared to send his goons after his woman. ,London is one hell of a big city, but is it big enough to contain the romance of Gina and Nick? Gina might want Nick, but the fiercely independent Londoner is going to make Nick earn her. Being a determined, sexy male, Nick is more than up for the challenge. Heâ€™s going to make Gina his wife, and no one is going to get in the way. Not even the future Mrs. De Canaveze.",dont touch the hot italian was a mantra gina robinson had spent the last ten years repeating to herself about her best friend nick da canaveze she had to repeat it often as nick was hot beyond all reason with a crazybuilt body a wicked sense of humour and brains he was the kind of man who could bring a woman pleasure with little more than a sideways glance she had to give herself a slap on the wrist whenever she caught herself looking and she lookeda lot looking at nick made her eyes feel good being with nick made her feel good and she needed to feel good considering the state of her life her father had recently passed away she was drowning in debt and she was being hounded for money at every turn it wasnt the creditors who had her worriedit was those other guys deep down she knew nick could make everything better but she wasnt going to ruin their friendship she really wanted tobut she couldnt while she might playfully call him soprano nick was her sweet dude she could lookand fantasizeand drool discreetly but she must not touch everyone knew how nick felt about gina everyone except for gina ten years was a long time to wait for the girl you love to get a clue especially when it only took him a month to realise he wanted to worship at the altar of her body every day for the rest of his life hed dated other women but all along hed known gina was the one for him gina wasnt just good for him she was perfect for him she met all the requirements for the sort of woman his family would approve of a she could cook italian better than his mother dont tell his mother and b she spoke italian beautifully the only problem was c she wasnt a nice italian girl who would walk ten paces behind him do everything he commanded and ask no questions he knew c wasnt going to happen in this lifetime and he wouldnt have it any other wayall she needed to do was meet his own two requirements love sex and love him while he wasnt sure if she loved sex hed spent many nights imagining just how much she could do did her beautiful chocolate skin taste as good as it looked would she moan his name or scream it when he brought her to climax best friends for a decade they shared everythingexcept what his family really did for a living impatient at the best of times nick kept telling himself to wait for the right time to reveal the truth then an incident that put gina in real danger made him realise he was done waiting around it also made him admit what everyone else already knew gina was unequivocally his no one else was going to sweep in and take what belonged to him da canavezes never let anyone take from them and only those who wanted to meet god sooner rather than later attempted such a thing once he got around the whole hi soprano bye soprano can you make me a cup of tea soprano platonicfriendship nonsense that had up to now categorized their relationship nick vowed to get around to teaching her new phrases like harder soprano deeper soprano youre going to make me break the sound barrier when i scream out your name soprano knowing just how independent gina was he decided hed give her space to accept that being mrs da canaveze was what the future held of course hed keep giving her his intense lovemaking until hed convinced her after hed convinced her maybe then hed mention what he and his family really did for a living it might make a difference with everyone else but he wouldnt let gina use that to keep him away from her he would explain it she would definitely yell he would put his foot down she was his end of story and then all hell broke loose in the guise of his mother nick finally found his hands full he had a woman to try to keep hold of an overbearing mother to calm down and business to deal with gina might see the da canaveze name simply as the surname that would soon be hers but that name was whispered with respect gina might think of him as her dude but those whod crossed him populated more than a few unmarked graves and hed already reserved one for the man whod dared to send his goons after his woman london is one hell of a big city but is it big enough to contain the romance of gina and nick gina might want nick but the fiercely independent londoner is going to make nick earn her being a determined sexy male nick is more than up for the challenge hes going to make gina his wife and no one is going to get in the way not even the future mrs de canaveze,"['Romance', 'Romance', 'Interracial Romance', 'Adult Fiction', 'Erotica', 'Contemporary', 'Romance', 'Contemporary Romance', 'Mystery', 'Crime', 'Adult', 'Mystery', 'Romance', 'Romantic Suspense', 'Cultural']",4411,4.04,1279,79,

First published in 1963, Eight Men Out has become a timeless classic. Eliot Asinof has reconstructed the entire scene-by-scene story of the fantastic scandal in which eight Chicago White Sox players arranged with the nation's leading gamblers to throw the Series in Cincinnati. Mr. Asinof vividly describes the tense meetings, the hitches in the conniving, the actual plays in which the Series was thrown, the Grand Jury indictment, and the famous 1921 trial. Moving behind the scenes, he perceptively examines the motives and backgrounds of the players and the conditions that made the improbable fix all too possible. Here, too, is a graphic picture of the American underworld that managed the fix, the deeply shocked newspapermen who uncovered the story, and the war-exhausted nation that turned with relief and pride to the Series, only to be rocked by the scandal.

The features that make Burt Lancaster, Joan Crawford, Robert Mitchum, and Humphrey Bogart into noir heroes and heroines are carefully detailed here, as well as those camera angles, lighting effects, and story lines that characterize Fritz Lang, Samuel Fuller, and Orson Welles as noir directors.For the current rediscovery of film noir, this comprehensive history with its list of credits to 112 outstanding films and its many illustrations will be a valuable reference and a source of inspiration for further research.",foster hirschs dark side of the screen is by far the most thorough and entertaining study of the themes visual motifs character types actors directors and films in this genre ever published from billy wilder douglas sirk robert aldrich and howard hawkes to martin scorsese roman polanski and paul schrader the noir themes of dread paranoia steamy sex doublecrossing women and menacing cityscapes have held a fascination the features that make burt lancaster joan crawford robert mitchum and humphrey bogart into noir heroes and heroines are carefully detailed here as well as those camera angles lighting effects and story lines that characterize fritz lang samuel fuller and orson welles as noir directorsfor the current rediscovery of film noir this comprehensive history with its list of credits to 112 outstanding films and its many illustrations will be a valuable reference and a source of inspiration for further research,"['Culture', 'Film', 'Nonfiction', 'Mystery', 'Noir', 'Media Tie In', 'History', 'Art', 'Mystery', 'Mystery', 'Crime', 'Culture', 'Pop Culture']",928,4.11,270,23,306802031

A Corpse in the Koryo,James  Church,"
  ,
    ,Against the backdrop of a totalitarian ,
    ,North Korea,
    ,, one man unwillingly uncovers the truth behind series of murders, and wagers his life in the process.,
  ,
  ,
  ,Sit on a quiet hillside at dawn among the wildflowers; take a picture of a car coming up a deserted highway from the south,. Simple orders for Inspector O, until he realizes they have led him far, far off his department's turf and into a maelstrom of betrayal and death. North Korea's leaders are desperate to hunt down and eliminate anyone who knows too much about a series of decades-old kidnappings and murders--and Inspector O discovers too late he has been sent into the chaos.,
  ,This is a world where nothing works as it should, where the crimes of the past haunt the present, and where even the shadows are real. A corpse in Pyongyang's main hotel---the Koryo---pulls Inspector O into a confrontation of bad choices between the devils he knows and those he doesn't want to meet. A blue button on the floor of a hotel closet, an ice blue Finnish lake, and desperate efforts by the North Korean leadership set Inspector O on a journey to the edge of a reality he almost can't survive. ,
  ,Like Philip Kerr's Berlin Noir trilogy and the Inspector Arkady Renko novels, ,A Corpse in the Koryo, introduces another unfamiliar world, a perplexing universe seemingly so alien that the rules are an enigma to the reader and even, sometimes, to Inspector O. Author James Church weaves a story with beautifully spare prose and layered descriptions of a country and a people he knows by heart after decades as an intelligence officer. This is a chilling portrayal that, in the end, leaves us wondering if what at first seemed unknowable may simply be too familiar for comfort.,
  ,Â ,
  ,
    ,Critical Acclaim for ,The Corpse in the Koryo,Â ,""This is a fine, intelligent, and exciting story that takes us into the netherworld of contemporary North Korean communism. It evokes the gray milieu without ever overstepping its mark, allowing us to see it from the inside rather than the outside, wherein the humanity of all the characters, both good and evil, is apparent. Inspector O is a particularly wonderful creation, a true mensch attempting to hold on to his humanity in a world where humanism is under constant attack. Subtlety is the method, and the result is fantastic work that should mark the beginning of a brilliant career for James Church."" ,---Olen Steinhauer, author of ,Liberation Movements,Â ,""For over fifty years Americans have tried to understand the world of North Korea. James Church does a better job of describing the isolated, impoverished, corrupt, and out- of-touch life in the North than anything I have seen. This novel is a must-read for anyone who would understand how precarious the dictatorship is."",---Newt Gingrich, author of ,Winning Back the Future, and ,Never Call Retreat,Â ,""A gripping story of mystery and intrigue. The laconic Inspector O follows in the traditions of Inspector Arkady Renko, operating in a world of complexity and danger we're meeting here for the first time."" ,---Don Oberdorfer, author of ,Tet!, ,""Church's debut thriller breaks new ground. O is an original. This is an expert take on a complex, brutal, and mystifying society. Immerse yourself in it."" ,---Marshall Browne, author of ,Eye of the Abyss, and the Inspector Anders series ,Â ,"",The Corpse in the Koryo, is a spellbinder. Bloody and chilling, yet subtle in its psychological detail, with an amazing understanding of North Korea."" ,---Ezra F. Vogel, Henry Ford II Professor of the Social Sciences, Harvard University Asia Center,Â ,""The (pseudonymous) author, a veteran intelligence officer, has intimate knowledge of Asian life and politics, and it shows: He gives the North Korea setting a feeling of palpable reality, depicting the nature of daily life under a totalitarian government not just with broad sociopolitical descriptions but also with specific everyday details. . . . There is also a little of Martin Cruz Smith's early Arkady Renko novels here. The writing is superb, too, well above the level usually associated with a first novel, richly layered and visually evocative."" ,---Booklist, (starred review),

Holy Horrors: An Illustrated History of Religious Murder and Madness,James A. Haught,"When you think of saints, you envision stained-glass pictures of piety. But the truth can be horribly different. Consider Saint Pius V: As Grand Inquisitor, he sent Catholic troops to kill 2,000 Waldensian Protestants in southern Italy. After becoming pope, he sent Catholic troops to kill Huguenot Protestants in France. Pius also launched the final crusade against Muslims, sending a Christian naval armada to slaughter thousands in the Battle of Lepanto in 1571. And, he intensified the Roman Inquisition, torturing and burning Catholics whose beliefs varied from official dogma. After his death, Pius was canonized a saint. Heaven help us.,Holy Horrors, chronicles the grim spectrum of religious persecution from ancient times to the present, including such historic massacres as the Crusades, the Islamic jihads, the Catholic wars against heretics, the Inquisition, witch hunts, the Reformation, and such atrocities as the Holocaust, the seemingly insoluble Catholic-Protestant schism in Northern Ireland, religious tribalism in Lebanon, and the barbaric cruelty of the theocracy in Iran.

The Sleeping Doll,Jeffery Deaver,"When Special Agent Kathryn Dance -- a brilliant interrogator and kinesics expert with the California Bureau of Investigation -- is sent to question the convicted killer Daniel ""Son of Manson"" Pell as a suspect in a newly unearthed crime, she feels both trepidation and electrifying intrigue. Pell is serving a life sentence for the brutal murders of the wealthy Croyton family in Carmel years earlier -- a crime mirroring those perpetrated by Charles Manson in the 1960s. But Pell and his cult members were sloppy: Not only were they apprehended, they even left behind a survivor -- the youngest of the Croyton daughters, who, because she was in bed hidden by her toys that terrible night, was dubbed the Sleeping Doll.,But the girl never spoke about that night, nor did the crime's mastermind. Indeed, Pell has long been both reticent and unrepentant about the crime. And so with the murderer transported from the Capitola superprison to an interrogation room in the Monterey County Courthouse, Dance sees an opportunity to pry a confession from him for the recent murder -- and to learn more about the depraved mind of this career criminal who considers himself a master of control, a dark Svengali, forcing people to do what they otherwise would never conceive of doing. In an electrifying psychological jousting match, Dance calls up all her skills as an interrogator and kinesics -- body language -- expert to get to the truth behind Daniel Pell.,But when Dance's plan goes terribly wrong and Pell escapes, leaving behind a trail of dead and injured, she finds herself in charge of her first-ever manhunt. But far from simply fleeing, Pell turns on his pursuers --and other innocents -- for reasons Dance and her colleagues can't discern. As the idyllic Monterey Peninsula is paralyzed by the elusive killer, Dance turns to the past to find the truth about what Daniel Pell is really up to. She tracks down the now teenage Sleeping Doll to learn what really happened that night, and she arranges a reunion of three women who were in his cult at the time of the killings. The lies of the past and the evasions of the present boil up under the relentless probing of Kathryn Dance, but will the truth about Daniel Pell emerge in time to stop him from killing again?",when special agent kathryn dance a brilliant interrogator and kinesics expert with the california bureau of investigation is sent to question the convicted killer daniel son of manson pell as a suspect in a newly unearthed crime she feels both trepidation and electrifying intrigue pell is serving a life sentence for the brutal murders of the wealthy croyton family in carmel years earlier a crime mirroring those perpetrated by charles manson in the 1960s but pell and his cult members were sloppy not only were they apprehended they even left behind a survivor the youngest of the croyton daughters who because she was in bed hidden by her toys that terrible night was dubbed the sleeping dollbut the girl never spoke about that night nor did the crimes mastermind indeed pell has long been both reticent and unrepentant about the crime and so with the murderer transported from the capitola superprison to an interrogation room in the monterey county courthouse dance sees an opportunity to pry a confession from him for the recent murder and to learn more about the depraved mind of this career criminal who considers himself a master of control a dark svengali forcing people to do what they otherwise would never conceive of doing in an electrifying psychological jousting match dance calls up all her skills as an interrogator and kinesics body language expert to get to the truth behind daniel pellbut when dances plan goes terribly wrong and pell escapes leaving behind a trail of dead and injured she finds herself in charge of her firstever manhunt but far from simply fleeing pell turns on his pursuers and other innocents for reasons dance and her colleagues cant discern as the idyllic monterey peninsula is paralyzed by the elusive killer dance turns to the past to find the truth about what daniel pell is really up to she tracks down the now teenage sleeping doll to learn what really happened that night and she arranges a reunion of three women who were in his cult at the time of the killings the lies of the past and the evasions of the present boil up under the relentless probing of kathryn dance but will the truth about daniel pell emerge in time to stop him from killing again,"['Mystery', 'Thriller', 'Fiction', 'Mystery', 'Crime', 'Suspense', 'Thriller', 'Mystery Thriller', 'Mystery', 'Detective', 'Audiobook', 'Mystery', 'Murder Mystery', 'Adult']",2203,3.93,17030,1043,034083384X

Lovecraft, as well.,As she notes in her introduction to ELEMENTARY EROTICA: ""I was surprised by the overwhelming response I got when I requested [these] erotic stories. Holmesâ€™s apparent distaste for women and seeming lack of interest in sex make him an unlikely hero for an erotic story, but each of these authors found their own unique way of dealing with this problem. The backdrop of Victorian England is one filled with tension and danger for homosexual men.This was a time and a place where it was illegal to be gay, plain and simple. Weâ€™d do well to remember that Holmes was not always a devotee of the law."",By transforming the Victorian figure into an erotic one, these stories make social commentary on the repressiveness of the Victorian age and fear of sexuality in our own times. They are simultaneously parodic, through their use of known settings and tropes, and erotic, through their liberation of the previously unwritten sexuality of the characters.",in these seven stories our authors explore the allure and simmering sexuality of the victorian ages greatest detective through the fantastical lens of steampunk editor j blackmore known for her erotic steampunk anthologies continues her romp through the literary boudoirs of the victorian age that has previously included lewis carroll and which will soon encompass jane austen and hp lovecraft as wellas she notes in her introduction to elementary erotica i was surprised by the overwhelming response i got when i requested these erotic stories holmess apparent distaste for women and seeming lack of interest in sex make him an unlikely hero for an erotic story but each of these authors found their own unique way of dealing with this problem the backdrop of victorian england is one filled with tension and danger for homosexual menthis was a time and a place where it was illegal to be gay plain and simple wed do well to remember that holmes was not always a devotee of the lawby transforming the victorian figure into an erotic one these stories make social commentary on the repressiveness of the victorian age and fear of sexuality in our own times they are simultaneously parodic through their use of known settings and tropes and erotic through their liberation of the previously unwritten sexuality of the characters,"['Adult Fiction', 'Erotica', 'Science Fiction', 'Steampunk', 'Romance', 'M M Romance', 'Fan Fiction', 'Romance', 'LGBT', 'Mystery', 'Fiction']",1328,3.61,23,5,
