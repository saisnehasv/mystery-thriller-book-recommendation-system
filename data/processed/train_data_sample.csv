And the Dead Shall Rise: The Murder of Mary Phagan and the Lynching of Leo Frank,Steve Oney,"On April 27, 1913, the bludgeoned body of thirteen-year-old Mary Phagan was discovered in the basement of Atlantaâ€™s National Pencil Factory. The girlâ€™s murder would be the catalyst for an epic saga that to this day holds a singular place in Americaâ€™s collective imaginationâ€”a saga that would climax in 1915 with the lynching of Leo Frank, the Cornell-educated Jew who was convicted of the murder. The case has been the subject of novels, plays, movies and even musicals, but only now, with the publication of ,And the Dead Shall Rise,, do we have an account that does full justice to the mesmerizing and previously unknown details of one of the most shameful moments in the nationâ€™s history.,In a narrative reminiscent of a nineteenth-century novel, Steve Oney recounts the emerging revelations of the initial criminal investigation, reconstructs from newspaper dispatches (the original trial transcript mysteriously disappeared long ago) the day-to-day intrigue of the courtroom and illuminates how and why an all-white jury convicted Frank largely on the testimony of a black man. Oney chronicles as well the innumerable avenues that the defense pursued in quest of an appeal, the remarkable and heretofore largely ignored campaign conducted by William Randolph Hearst and New York Times publisher Adolph Ochs to exonerate Frank, the last-minute commutation of Frankâ€™s death sentence and, most indelibly, the flawlessly executed abduction and brutal lynching of Frank two months after his death sentence was commuted.,And the Dead Shall Rise, brings to life a Dickensian cast of characters caught up in the Frank caseâ€”zealous police investigators intent on protecting their departmentâ€™s reputation, even more zealous private detectives, cynical yet impressionable factory girls, intrepid reporters (including a young Harold Ross), lawyers blinded by their own interests and cowed by the populaceâ€™s furor. And we meet four astonishing individuals: Jim Conley, who was Frankâ€™s confessed â€œaccompliceâ€ and the stateâ€™s star witness; William Smith, a determined and idealistic lawyer who brilliantly prepared Conley for the defenseâ€™s fierce cross-examination and then, a year later, underwent an extraordinary change of heart; Lucille Frank, the martyred wife of the convicted man; and the great populist leader Tom Watson, who manipulated the volatile and lethal outrage of Georgians against the forces of Northern privilege and capital that were seeking to free Frank.,And the Dead Shall Rise, also casts long-awaited fresh light on Frankâ€™s lynching. No participant was ever indicted, and many went on to prominent careers in state and national politics. Here, for the first time, is the full account of the eventâ€”including the identities of the influential Georgians who conceived, carried out and covered up the crime. And here as well is the story of the lynchingâ€™s aftermath, which saw both the revival of the Ku Klux Klan and the evolution of the Anti-Defamation League.,At once a work of masterful investigative journalism and insightful social history, ,And the Dead Shall Rise, does complete justice to one of historyâ€™s most repellent and most fascinating moments.",on april 27 1913 the bludgeoned body of thirteenyearold mary phagan was discovered in the basement of atlantas national pencil factory the girls murder would be the catalyst for an epic saga that to this day holds a singular place in americas collective imaginationa saga that would climax in 1915 with the lynching of leo frank the cornelleducated jew who was convicted of the murder the case has been the subject of novels plays movies and even musicals but only now with the publication of and the dead shall rise do we have an account that does full justice to the mesmerizing and previously unknown details of one of the most shameful moments in the nations historyin a narrative reminiscent of a nineteenthcentury novel steve oney recounts the emerging revelations of the initial criminal investigation reconstructs from newspaper dispatches the original trial transcript mysteriously disappeared long ago the daytoday intrigue of the courtroom and illuminates how and why an allwhite jury convicted frank largely on the testimony of a black man oney chronicles as well the innumerable avenues that the defense pursued in quest of an appeal the remarkable and heretofore largely ignored campaign conducted by william randolph hearst and new york times publisher adolph ochs to exonerate frank the lastminute commutation of franks death sentence and most indelibly the flawlessly executed abduction and brutal lynching of frank two months after his death sentence was commutedand the dead shall rise brings to life a dickensian cast of characters caught up in the frank casezealous police investigators intent on protecting their departments reputation even more zealous private detectives cynical yet impressionable factory girls intrepid reporters including a young harold ross lawyers blinded by their own interests and cowed by the populaces furor and we meet four astonishing individuals jim conley who was franks confessed accomplice and the states star witness william smith a determined and idealistic lawyer who brilliantly prepared conley for the defenses fierce crossexamination and then a year later underwent an extraordinary change of heart lucille frank the martyred wife of the convicted man and the great populist leader tom watson who manipulated the volatile and lethal outrage of georgians against the forces of northern privilege and capital that were seeking to free frankand the dead shall rise also casts longawaited fresh light on franks lynching no participant was ever indicted and many went on to prominent careers in state and national politics here for the first time is the full account of the eventincluding the identities of the influential georgians who conceived carried out and covered up the crime and here as well is the story of the lynchings aftermath which saw both the revival of the ku klux klan and the evolution of the antidefamation leagueat once a work of masterful investigative journalism and insightful social history and the dead shall rise does complete justice to one of historys most repellent and most fascinating moments,"['Crime', 'True Crime', 'History', 'Nonfiction', 'Mystery', 'Crime', 'Law', 'North American Hi...', 'American History', 'Mystery', 'Biography', 'Historical', 'American', 'Southern']",3081,4.04,378,52,679421475

The Great Big Book of Horrible Things: The Definitive Chronicle of History's 100 Worst Atrocities,Matthew   White,"Evangelists of human progress meet their opposite in Matthew White's epic examination of history's one hundred most violent events, or, in White's piquant phrasing, ""the numbers that people want to argue about."" Reaching back to 480 BCE's second Persian War, White moves chronologically through history to this century's war in the Congo and devotes chapters to each event, where he surrounds hard facts (time and place) and succinct takeaways (who usually gets the blame?) with lively military, social, and political histories. With the eye of a seasoned statistician, White assigns each entry a ranking based on body count, and in doing so he gives voice to the suffering of ordinary people that, inexorably, has defined every historical epoch.

The Gallows Murders,Michael Clynes,"In the summer of 1523, the weather has turned hot and the sweating sickness has returned to London to provide a fertile breeding ground for terrible murders and the most treasonable conspiracies. King Henry VIII has moved the court to Windsor, where he slakes his lusts while the kingdom is being governed by his first minister, Cardinal Thomas Wolsey. Wolsey, however, is not having an easy time. Someone is sending the king threatening letters from the tower, despatched under the name and seal of Edward, one of the princes supposedly murdered there, and demanding that great amounts of gold be left in different parts of London. If the orders are not carried out, proclamations will be published throughout the capital which, coinciding with the outbreak of plague, may make it look as though the hand of God has turned against the Tudors for usurping the throne. Henry VIII is truly terrified - and also intrigued by the mysterious and grisly murders occurring among the hangmen of London, whose guild also happens to meet in the tower. Wolsey has only two people to turn to: his beloved nephew, Benjamin Daunbey, and Daunbey's faithful servant, Roger Shallot, who reluctantly agree to go to London to unmask the blackmailer and end the macabre murders among the hangmen. Benjamin and Roger first meet with disaster in the murky Tudor underworld. They also become immersed in the ghastly world of the Gallowsmen, the royal executioners, many of whom are dying the same hideous deaths that they have meted out to others. And at the same time they must confront the mystery of the princes of the tower - an ancient murder that still haunts the English throne.

In an attempt to stave off disaster, the intelligence agencies will try to do what no one has ever done before-pass off a Westerner as an Arab among Arabs-pass off Martin as the trusted Khan.,It will require extraordinary preparation, and then extraordinary luck, for nothing can truly prepare Martin for the dark and shifting world into which he is about to enter.

The Absent City,"Ricardo Piglia,Sergio Waisman","Widely acclaimed throughout Latin America after its 1992 release in Argentina, ,The Absent City, takes the form of a futuristic detective novel. In the end, however, it is a meditation on the nature of totalitarian regimes, on the transition to democracy after the end of such regimes, and on the power of language to create and define reality. Ricardo Piglia combines his trademark avant-garde aesthetics with astute cultural and political insights into Argentinaâ€™s history and contemporary condition in this conceptually daring and entertaining work.,The novel follows Junior, a reporter for a daily Buenos Aires newspaper, as he attempts to locate a secret machine that contains the mind and the memory of a woman named Elena. While Elena produces stories that reflect on actual events in Argentina, the police are seeking her destruction because of the revelations of atrocities that sheâ€”the machineâ€”is disseminating through texts and taped recordings. The book thus portrays the race to recover the history and memory of a city and a country where history has largely been obliterated by political repression. Its narrativesâ€”all part of a detective story, all part of something moreâ€”multiply as they intersect with each other, like the streets and avenues of Buenos Aires itself. ,The second of Pigliaâ€™s novels to be translated by Duke University Pressâ€”the first was ,Artifical Respiration,â€”this book continues the authorâ€™s quest to portray the abuses and atrocities that characterize dictatorships as well as the difficulties associated with making the transition to democracy.

Unfinished Lives: Reviving the Memories of LGBTQ Hate Crimes Victims,Stephen V. Sprinkle,"Synopsis: Over 13,000 Americans have been murdered in the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries because of their sexual orientation and gender presentation. In Unfinished Lives: Reviving the Memory of LGBTQ Hate Crimes Victims, Stephen Sprinkle puts a human face on the outrage and loss suffered when people die from anti-gay hatred. Beginning with new developments in the story of Matthew Shepard's murder in Laramie, Wyoming, Sprinkle tells the stories of fourteen representative LGBTQ victims whose lives were savagely cut short due to homophobia and transphobia. These are stories about people who could be your neighbor, classmate, co-worker, or friend - real, everyday people whose love was foreclosed, relationships brutally terminated, and future contributions stolen from us by outrageous, irrational hatred. Told lovingly yet unflinchingly, Unfinished Lives lifts the stories of these LGBTQ victims from undeserved obscurity, allowing their memory to live again. Relying on personal interviews and visits to the locations where these people lived, loved, and died, Sprinkle records the raw emotions, powerful movements for social change, and unexpectedly hopeful communities that arise from the ruins of those people whose only ""offense"" was to live as they were born to be. Part portraiture, part crime narrative, and part ethnography, Unfinished Lives is poised to change the conversation on hate crimes in the United States. Endorsements: ""Unfinished Lives cries out to be read . . . It speaks to the systematic denigration of LGBTQ people in the United States . . . and it offers hope that the cycles of abuse and hatred and violence can be broken-one person, one family, one community at a time."" -from the Foreword by Harry Knox Director of the Religion and Faith Program Human Rights Campaign, Washington, DC ""In telling these 'stories that trouble the soul' about the hateful murders of fourteen LBGTQ people who were selected for execution simply because of their non-conforming sexual orientation and gender presentation, Stephen Sprinkle has courageously refused to bury the victims in silence or go along with the cultural amnesia that tries to suggest 'it was all a mistake' and 'they were just in the wrong place at the wrong time.' No, anti-gay violence is an intentionally employed weapon of mass terror, and religion is often its accomplice. With a fierce determination to honor our dead by telling the truth out loud and proud, Sprinkle calls the community to take up the queer theological tasks of, yes, remembering and mourning, but also of community resistance and organizing to end the violence against us, against all peoples."" -Marvin M. Ellison Bangor Theological Seminary editor of Sexuality and the Sacred: Sources for Theological Reflection ""Stephen Sprinkle takes on one of the most profound questions of our time: When fear and hate and judgment result in violence and murder of non-gender conforming people, what is the right response of civil society? While we struggle to find the answer, he reminds us that the clock is ticking and lives are being lost. He honors the lives of those who have either been taken from us or grievously injured by our collective inaction. He labors at the leading edge of love, healing, and inclusion for all people, providing 'a walking systemtic intervention' where injustice resides."" -Cindi Love Executive Director of Soulforce Member of the Religion and Faith Program Human Rights Campaign, Washington, DC Author Bio: Stephen V.

The 13th Enumeration,William Struse,"In 43 AD, Levi ben Cheleph, a Roman customs official, composes a controversial genealogy of Jesus. For the next nineteen centuries, this list becomes one of the most disputed texts of the New Testament and the basis for one of the most important biblical secrets of all time. The 13th Enumeration is the key to that forgotten secret.,Darius Zaridast, CEO of Aquarius Elemental Solutions, is on a quest to destroy those he believes are responsible for the death of his father and the status of his homeland, Persia, as a third-world dictatorship ruled by religious fanatics. Darius finds evidence that this group, which he calls the Order, is also part of a centuries-old conspiracy to keep the secret of the 13th Enumeration. This secret, he learns, is their greatest fear because it is the key to information that could destroy them.,His research into this secretive group of people is compiled in a dossier he calls FILE-13. Darius believes some of history's most influential men are somehow connected to the secret:,*Sir Isaac Newton, one of the most influential scientists of all time, spent a good portion of his life looking for a hidden biblical code.,*Charles Thomson, one of only two signers of the original Declaration of Independence, was responsible for the most notorious symbol in American history. This symbol, known by only a few, is a key to the secret.,*William Frishmuth, a German chemist and secret agent for Abraham Lincoln, was so valued for his services he was paid two hundred dollars from Abraham Lincoln's private purse. ,*William Colgate of Colgate/Palmolive, one of America's early entrepreneurs, owned a building which featured an unsolved brick symbol--a symbol which today is known as the ""American Da Vinci Code."" This cipher holds the key to the forgotten secret.,*Sir Robert Anderson, commissioner of Scotland Yard during the Ripper murders, almost discovered the secret.,*Benjamin Franklin, writer, inventor, philosopher, and statesman, may have been involved in guarding this ancient knowledge.,As Darius's plot for revenge matures, he initiates the most devastating attack in the history of New York's financial district. With Manhattan Island a ghost town, Darius uses the ensuing events to perpetrate the greatest financial manipulation of all time. Just when he has the world convinced he is its savior, Darius Zarindast destroys his entire corporate empire, causing the largest financial meltdown in history. He has finally realized his revenge. The only bitterness in his cup of retribution is his inability to solve the secret of the 13th Enumeration.,In this battlefield of revenge, conspiracy, and superstition, an archeological discovery is made in Capernaum, Israel--a discovery which will forever change the way the prophecies of the Bible are understood. Zane Harrison, a dig volunteer, and Rachael Neumann, daughter of the director of Israeli Antiquities, unwittingly stumble upon an incredible treasure of artifacts. Their find leads to the rediscovery of the 13th Enumeration. They soon learn their discovery is the key to a mathematical cipher found in the very first chapter of the New Testament, an ancient code which has profound implications regarding the status of Jesus Christ as the biblical Messiah. The unearthing of this ancient secret places them directly in the crosshairs of the Order. Will they be able to share their discovery with the world before the Order destroys the evidence and once again erases all knowledge of the 13th Enumeration from the pages of history?,The 13th Enumeration is a thrilling page-turner which weaves little-known historical and biblical facts into a plot that could have been taken from today's headlines.

Bleeding Edge,Thomas Pynchon,"Thomas Pynchon brings us to New York in the early days of the internet,It is 2001 in New York City, in the lull between the collapse of the dot-com boom and the terrible events of September 11th. Silicon Alley is a ghost town, Web 1.0 is having adolescent angst, Google has yet to IPO, Microsoft is still considered the Evil Empire. There may not be quite as much money around as there was at the height of the tech bubble, but thereâ€™s no shortage of swindlers looking to grab a piece of whatâ€™s left.,Maxine Tarnow is running a nice little fraud investigation business on the Upper West Side, chasing down different kinds of small-scale con artists. She used to be legally certified but her license got pulled a while back, which has actually turned out to be a blessing because now she can follow her own code of ethicsâ€”carry a Beretta, do business with sleazebags, hack into peopleâ€™s bank accountsâ€”without having too much guilt about any of it. Otherwise, just your average working momâ€”two boys in elementary school, an off-and-on situation with her sort of semi-ex-husband Horst, life as normal as it ever gets in the neighborhoodâ€”till Maxine starts looking into the finances of a computer-security firm and its billionaire geek CEO, whereupon things begin rapidly to jam onto the subway and head downtown. She soon finds herself mixed up with a drug runner in an art deco motorboat, a professional nose obsessed with Hitlerâ€™s aftershave, a neoliberal enforcer with footwear issues, plus elements of the Russian mob and various bloggers, hackers, code monkeys, and entrepreneurs, some of whom begin to show up mysteriously dead. Foul play, of course.,With occasional excursions into the DeepWeb and out to Long Island, Thomas Pynchon, channeling his inner Jewish mother, brings us a historical romance of New York in the early days of the internet, not that distant in calendar time but galactically remote from where weâ€™ve journeyed to since.,Will perpetrators be revealed, forget about brought to justice?

Criminal Intent,William Bernhardt,"When a priest with radical ideas and a parish council with traditional values lock horns over the beliefs they hold most sacred, there's bound to be controversy--and consequences. But murder crosses the line between committing a sin and committing a crime, turning a battle over faith into a battle for justice. And smack in the middle of the explosive case is Tulsa attorney Ben Kincaid.,Kincaid rescued Father Daniel Beale once before. When the priest's renegade views and violent temper nearly cost him his position as rector of St. Benedict's Church, Ben intervened and saved the day. Now Beale is the prime suspect in the brutal murder of a female parishioner--though lack of evidence has left the case unsolved. But as Father Beale struggles to escape the shadow of suspicion, another woman is savagely slaughtered. And this time, Ben himself discovers Beale literally red-handed . . . with the blood of the victim.,As Father Beale declares his innocence, Ben and his team feverishly work to build a defense that will deliver the man of God from a date with the death chamber. But each new revelation that emerges in the packed courtroom only serves to tilt the scales increasingly in the prosecution's favor. And Father Beale's own shocking testimony ignites a firestorm of controversy that could doom his last best hope for acquittal.,In his heart and in his gut, Ben knows Father Beale is innocent. But proving it means taking a leap of faith that will plunge Ben into the whirlpool of dark secrets and dangerous intentions that surround St. Benedict's. And ultimately, it will force the idealistic attorney to confront the chilling face of evil in the most unexpected of places.,Criminal Intent, proves beyond a reasonable doubt that the author of ,Murder One, has earned his critical reputation as the master of the courtroom drama whose novels of legal suspense consistently offer a one-of-a-kind reading experience.",when a priest with radical ideas and a parish council with traditional values lock horns over the beliefs they hold most sacred theres bound to be controversyand consequences but murder crosses the line between committing a sin and committing a crime turning a battle over faith into a battle for justice and smack in the middle of the explosive case is tulsa attorney ben kincaidkincaid rescued father daniel beale once before when the priests renegade views and violent temper nearly cost him his position as rector of st benedicts church ben intervened and saved the day now beale is the prime suspect in the brutal murder of a female parishionerthough lack of evidence has left the case unsolved but as father beale struggles to escape the shadow of suspicion another woman is savagely slaughtered and this time ben himself discovers beale literally redhanded with the blood of the victimas father beale declares his innocence ben and his team feverishly work to build a defense that will deliver the man of god from a date with the death chamber but each new revelation that emerges in the packed courtroom only serves to tilt the scales increasingly in the prosecutions favor and father beales own shocking testimony ignites a firestorm of controversy that could doom his last best hope for acquittalin his heart and in his gut ben knows father beale is innocent but proving it means taking a leap of faith that will plunge ben into the whirlpool of dark secrets and dangerous intentions that surround st benedicts and ultimately it will force the idealistic attorney to confront the chilling face of evil in the most unexpected of placescriminal intent proves beyond a reasonable doubt that the author of murder one has earned his critical reputation as the master of the courtroom drama whose novels of legal suspense consistently offer a oneofakind reading experience,"['Mystery', 'Fiction', 'Thriller', 'Legal Thriller', 'Audiobook', 'Thriller', 'Mystery Thriller', 'Mystery', 'Crime']",1876,3.85,590,35,345441753

The Strongest Poison,Mark Lane,"Jim Jones hired Lane & Don Freed in '78 to help make the case of what he alleged to be a ""grand conspiracy"" by intelligence agencies against the Peoples Temple. Jones told Lane he wanted to ""pull an Eldridge Cleaver"", referring to the fugitive Black Panther who was able to return to the USA after repairing his reputation. Lane visited Jonestown in 9/78 & spoke to residents who provided support for the theory that intelligence agencies conspired against them & drew parallels between Martin Luther King & Jim Jones. Lane then held press conferences stating ""none of the charges"" against the Temple ""are accurate or true"" & that there was a conspiracy against the Temple by ""intelligence organizations,"" naming the CIA, FBI, FCC & Post Office. Lane represented himself as disinterested, but the Temple paid him $6k monthly. Regarding the effect of the work of Lane & Freed upon members, Temple member Annie Moore wrote that ""Mom & Dad have probably shown you the latest about the conspiracy information that Mark Lane, the famous attorney in the ML King case & Don Freed the other famous author in the Kennedy case have come up with regarding activities planned against us--Peoples Temple."" Another member, Carolyn Layton, wrote that Freed told them that ""anything this drug out could be nothing less than conspiracy""., Lane was present in Jonestown during the events of 11/18/78, when over 900 Temple members died in murder-suicide by cyanide, & Rep. Leo Ryan & four others were murdered at a nearby airstrip. For months before that tragedy, Jones frequently created fear among members by stating that the CIA & other intelligence agencies were conspiring with ""capitalist pigs"" to destroy Jonestown & harm its members. This included mentions of CIA involvement in the address Jones gave the day before the arrival of Ryan., During the visit of Ryan, Lane helped represent the Temple with its other attorney, Charles R. Garry, who was furious with Lane for holding numerous press conferences & alleging the existence of conspiracies against the Temple. Garry was also displeased with him for making a veiled threat that the Temple might move to the USSR in a letter to Ryan., Late in the afternoon of 11/18, two men wielding rifles approached Lane & Garry, who'd earlier been sent to a small wooden house by Jones. It's unclear whether the men were sent to kill them, but one recognized Garry as an attorney in a trial he'd attended. After a friendly exchange, the men told Garry & Lane that they were going to ""commit revolutionary suicide"" to ""expose this racist & fascist society"". The gunmen then gave Garry & Lane directions to exit Jonestown. Garry & Lane hid in the jungle while events unfolded., On a tape made while members committed suicide by ingesting poisoned punch, the reason given by Jones to commit suicide was consistent with Jones' previously stated theories of intelligence organizations allegedly conspiring against the Temple, that men would ""parachute in here on us"", ""shoot some of our innocent babies"" & ""they'll torture our children, they'll torture some of our people here, they'll torture our seniors"". Parroting Jones' prior statements that hostile forces would convert captured children to Fascism, one temple member stated ""the ones that they take captured, they're gonna just let them grow up and be dummies"". Annie Moore & Carolyn Layton were among the 900 who died., Lane later wrote about the tragedy in The Strongest Poison. He reported hearing automatic weapons & suspects US forces killed Jonestown survivors. While Lane blames Jones & Temple leadership for the deaths, he also claims that US officials exacerbated the possibility of violence by employing agents provocateur. For example, Lane claimed that Temple attorney & later defector Timothy Stoen, who Lane alleged had repeatedly prompted the Temple to take radical action before defecting, ""had evidently led three lives"", one as a government informant.",jim jones hired lane don freed in 78 to help make the case of what he alleged to be a grand conspiracy by intelligence agencies against the peoples temple jones told lane he wanted to pull an eldridge cleaver referring to the fugitive black panther who was able to return to the usa after repairing his reputation lane visited jonestown in 978 spoke to residents who provided support for the theory that intelligence agencies conspired against them drew parallels between martin luther king jim jones lane then held press conferences stating none of the charges against the temple are accurate or true that there was a conspiracy against the temple by intelligence organizations naming the cia fbi fcc post office lane represented himself as disinterested but the temple paid him 6k monthly regarding the effect of the work of lane freed upon members temple member annie moore wrote that mom dad have probably shown you the latest about the conspiracy information that mark lane the famous attorney in the ml king case don freed the other famous author in the kennedy case have come up with regarding activities planned against uspeoples temple another member carolyn layton wrote that freed told them that anything this drug out could be nothing less than conspiracy lane was present in jonestown during the events of 111878 when over 900 temple members died in murdersuicide by cyanide rep leo ryan four others were murdered at a nearby airstrip for months before that tragedy jones frequently created fear among members by stating that the cia other intelligence agencies were conspiring with capitalist pigs to destroy jonestown harm its members this included mentions of cia involvement in the address jones gave the day before the arrival of ryan during the visit of ryan lane helped represent the temple with its other attorney charles r garry who was furious with lane for holding numerous press conferences alleging the existence of conspiracies against the temple garry was also displeased with him for making a veiled threat that the temple might move to the ussr in a letter to ryan late in the afternoon of 1118 two men wielding rifles approached lane garry whod earlier been sent to a small wooden house by jones its unclear whether the men were sent to kill them but one recognized garry as an attorney in a trial hed attended after a friendly exchange the men told garry lane that they were going to commit revolutionary suicide to expose this racist fascist society the gunmen then gave garry lane directions to exit jonestown garry lane hid in the jungle while events unfolded on a tape made while members committed suicide by ingesting poisoned punch the reason given by jones to commit suicide was consistent with jones previously stated theories of intelligence organizations allegedly conspiring against the temple that men would parachute in here on us shoot some of our innocent babies theyll torture our children theyll torture some of our people here theyll torture our seniors parroting jones prior statements that hostile forces would convert captured children to fascism one temple member stated the ones that they take captured theyre gonna just let them grow up and be dummies annie moore carolyn layton were among the 900 who died lane later wrote about the tragedy in the strongest poison he reported hearing automatic weapons suspects us forces killed jonestown survivors while lane blames jones temple leadership for the deaths he also claims that us officials exacerbated the possibility of violence by employing agents provocateur for example lane claimed that temple attorney later defector timothy stoen who lane alleged had repeatedly prompted the temple to take radical action before defecting had evidently led three lives one as a government informant,"['Nonfiction', 'History', 'Crime', 'True Crime', 'Religion', 'Cults', 'Biography']",3794,3.66,29,7,080153206X

Political crimes were â€˜specialâ€™, whereas theft, robbery and even murder, no matter how terrible, were â€˜ordinaryâ€™.,Dublin, June 1887: the mutilated bodies of a man and a child are discovered in Phoenix Park and Detective Sergeant Joe Swallow steps up to investigate.

Breaking Their Will: Shedding Light on Religious Child Maltreatment,Janet Heimlich,"This revealing, disturbing, and thoroughly researched book exposes a dark side of faith that most Americans do not know exists or have ignored for a long timeâ€”religious child maltreatment. After speaking with dozens of victims, perpetrators, and experts, and reviewing a myriad of court cases and studies, the author explains how religious child maltreatment happens. She then takes an in-depth look at the many forms of child maltreatment found in religious contexts, including biblically-prescribed corporal punishment and beliefs about the necessity of ""breaking the wills"" of children; scaring kids into faith and other types of emotional maltreatment such as spurning, isolating, and withholding love; pedophilic abuse by religious authorities and the failure of religious organizations to support the victims and punish the perpetrators; and religiously-motivated medical neglect in cases of serious health problems. ,In a concluding chapter, Heimlich raises questions about childrenâ€™s rights and proposes changes in societal attitudes and improved legislation to protect children from harm. ,While fully acknowledging that religion can be a source of great comfort, strength, and inspiration to many young people, Heimlich makes a compelling case that, regardless of oneâ€™s religious or secular orientation, maltreatment of children under the cloak of religion can never be justified and should not be tolerated.",this revealing disturbing and thoroughly researched book exposes a dark side of faith that most americans do not know exists or have ignored for a long timereligious child maltreatment after speaking with dozens of victims perpetrators and experts and reviewing a myriad of court cases and studies the author explains how religious child maltreatment happens she then takes an indepth look at the many forms of child maltreatment found in religious contexts including biblicallyprescribed corporal punishment and beliefs about the necessity of breaking the wills of children scaring kids into faith and other types of emotional maltreatment such as spurning isolating and withholding love pedophilic abuse by religious authorities and the failure of religious organizations to support the victims and punish the perpetrators and religiouslymotivated medical neglect in cases of serious health problems in a concluding chapter heimlich raises questions about childrens rights and proposes changes in societal attitudes and improved legislation to protect children from harm while fully acknowledging that religion can be a source of great comfort strength and inspiration to many young people heimlich makes a compelling case that regardless of ones religious or secular orientation maltreatment of children under the cloak of religion can never be justified and should not be tolerated,"['Nonfiction', 'Religion', 'Psychology', 'Sociology', 'Crime', 'True Crime', 'Health', 'Mental Health', 'Spirituality', 'Sociology', 'Abuse', 'Religion', 'Atheism', 'Philosophy']",1385,3.99,136,19,161614405X

The Caves of Perigord,Martin  Walker,"In a brilliant and ambitious thriller that combines elements of Jean Auel's ""The Clan of the Cave Bear"" and Ken Follett's ""The Pillars of the Earth"" into a riveting, multifaceted tale of love, art, courage, and war, Martin Walker brings to life the creation of an extraordinary work of prehistoric cave art and the struggle to possess it in our own time. Walker's richly interwoven novel opens with the arrival of a mysterious package for a young American woman working in a London auction house. Brought by a British officer, it contains a 17,000-year-old fragment of a cave painting left to him by his father, a former World War II hero.,The fragment, significant and stunning in itself, is also the key to the existence of an un-known cave that may be more important in the history of art and human creation than the world-famous one at Lascaux. It triggers a storm of publicity and commands the attention of the French authorities all the way up to the President of the Republic, who seems to know more about the painting's origins than anyone else...,As the young American woman, the British officer, and a French government art historian explore the ancient province of Perigord to determine the painting's origins, their search serves as backdrop for three compelling stories.

"Hollow Earth: The Long and Curious History of Imagining Strange Lands, Fantastical Creatures, Advanced Civilizations, and Marvelous Machines Below the Earth's Surface",David Standish,"Beliefs in mysterious underworlds are as old as humanity. But the idea that the earth has a hollow interior was first proposed as a scientific theory in 1691 by Sir Edmond Halley (of comet fame), who also suggested that there might be life down there as well. ,Hollow Earth, traces the many surprising, marvelous, and just plain weird permutations his ideas have taken over the centuries. Both Edgar Allan Poe and (more famously) Jules Verne picked up the torch in the nineteenth century, the latter with his science fiction epic ,A Journey to the Center of the Earth,. The notion of a hollow earth even inspired a religion at the turn of the twentieth century-Koreshanity, which held not only that the earth was hollow, but also that we're all living on the ,inside,. Utopian novels and adventures abounded at this same time, including L. Frank Baum's hollow earth addition to the Oz series and Edgar Rice Burroughs's ,Pellucidar, books chronicling a stone-age hollow earth. In the 1940s an enterprising science-fiction magazine editor convinced people that the true origins of flying saucers lay within the hollow earth, relics of an advanced alien civilization. And there are still devout hollow earthers today, some of whom claim there is a New Age utopia lurking beneath the earth's surface, with at least one entrance near Mt. Shasta in California. ,Hollow Earth, travels through centuries and cultures, exploring how each era's relationship to the idea of a hollow earth mirrored its hopes, fears, and values. Illustrated with everything from seventeenth-century maps to 1950s pulp art to movie posters and more, ,Hollow Earth, is for anyone interested in the history of strange ideas that just won't go away.",beliefs in mysterious underworlds are as old as humanity but the idea that the earth has a hollow interior was first proposed as a scientific theory in 1691 by sir edmond halley of comet fame who also suggested that there might be life down there as well hollow earth traces the many surprising marvelous and just plain weird permutations his ideas have taken over the centuries both edgar allan poe and more famously jules verne picked up the torch in the nineteenth century the latter with his science fiction epic a journey to the center of the earth the notion of a hollow earth even inspired a religion at the turn of the twentieth centurykoreshanity which held not only that the earth was hollow but also that were all living on the inside utopian novels and adventures abounded at this same time including l frank baums hollow earth addition to the oz series and edgar rice burroughss pellucidar books chronicling a stoneage hollow earth in the 1940s an enterprising sciencefiction magazine editor convinced people that the true origins of flying saucers lay within the hollow earth relics of an advanced alien civilization and there are still devout hollow earthers today some of whom claim there is a new age utopia lurking beneath the earths surface with at least one entrance near mt shasta in california hollow earth travels through centuries and cultures exploring how each eras relationship to the idea of a hollow earth mirrored its hopes fears and values illustrated with everything from seventeenthcentury maps to 1950s pulp art to movie posters and more hollow earth is for anyone interested in the history of strange ideas that just wont go away,"['History', 'Nonfiction', 'Science', 'Fantasy', 'Mythology', 'Fantasy', 'Paranormal', 'Mystery', 'Occult', 'Historical']",1664,3.41,244,34,306813734

"The Village of Cannibals: Rage and Murder in France, 1870",Alain Corbin,"In August 1870, during a fair in the isolated French village of Hautefaye, a gruesome murder was committed in broad daylight that aroused the indignation of the entire country. A young nobleman, falsely accused of shouting republican slogans, was savagely tortured for hours by a mob of peasants who later burned him alive. Rumors of cannibalism stirred public fascination, and the details of the case were dramatically recounted in the popular press. While the crime was rife with political significance, the official inquiry focused on its brutality. Justice was swift: the mob's alleged ringleaders were guillotined at the scene of the crime the following winter.,The Village of Cannibals, is a fascinating inquiry by historian Alain Corbin into the social and political ingredients of an alchemy that transformed ordinary people into executioners in nineteenth-century France. Corbin's chronicle of the killing is significant for the new light it sheds on the final eruption of peasant rage in France to end in murder. No other author has investigated this harrowing event in such depth or brought to its study such a wealth of perspectives.,Corbin explores incidents of public violence during and after the French Revolution and illustrates how earlier episodes in France's history provide insight into the mob's methods and choice of victim. He describes in detail the peasants' perception of the political landscape and the climate of fear that fueled their anxiety and ignited long-smoldering hatreds. Drawing on the minutes of court proceedings, accounts of contemporary journalists, and testimony of eyewitnesses, the author offers a precise chronology of the chain of events that unfolded on the fairground that summer afternoon. His detailed investigation into the murder at Hautefaye reveals the political motivations of the murderers and the gulf between their actions and the sensibilities of the majority of French citizens, who no longer tolerated violence as a viable form of political expression. The book will be welcomed by scholars, students, and general readers for its compelling insights into the nature of collective violence.",in august 1870 during a fair in the isolated french village of hautefaye a gruesome murder was committed in broad daylight that aroused the indignation of the entire country a young nobleman falsely accused of shouting republican slogans was savagely tortured for hours by a mob of peasants who later burned him alive rumors of cannibalism stirred public fascination and the details of the case were dramatically recounted in the popular press while the crime was rife with political significance the official inquiry focused on its brutality justice was swift the mobs alleged ringleaders were guillotined at the scene of the crime the following winterthe village of cannibals is a fascinating inquiry by historian alain corbin into the social and political ingredients of an alchemy that transformed ordinary people into executioners in nineteenthcentury france corbins chronicle of the killing is significant for the new light it sheds on the final eruption of peasant rage in france to end in murder no other author has investigated this harrowing event in such depth or brought to its study such a wealth of perspectivescorbin explores incidents of public violence during and after the french revolution and illustrates how earlier episodes in frances history provide insight into the mobs methods and choice of victim he describes in detail the peasants perception of the political landscape and the climate of fear that fueled their anxiety and ignited longsmoldering hatreds drawing on the minutes of court proceedings accounts of contemporary journalists and testimony of eyewitnesses the author offers a precise chronology of the chain of events that unfolded on the fairground that summer afternoon his detailed investigation into the murder at hautefaye reveals the political motivations of the murderers and the gulf between their actions and the sensibilities of the majority of french citizens who no longer tolerated violence as a viable form of political expression the book will be welcomed by scholars students and general readers for its compelling insights into the nature of collective violence,"['History', 'Cultural', 'France', 'History', 'Microhistory', 'Nonfiction', 'Crime', 'True Crime', 'Academic', 'Historical']",2116,3.58,102,13,674939018

Now, in the most complex and shocking book of her long career, she delves into the motivation that drove a seemingly successful man to kill, and she explores heretofore unknown aspects of a fatal affair between a beautiful young woman who moved confidently in the heady world of the upper echelons of government and a widely admired millionaire attorney who was an immensely popular political figure., ,On June 27, 1996, thirty-year-old Anne Marie Fahey, who was the scheduling secretary for the governor of Delaware, had dinner with a man she had been having a secret affair with for more than two years. ""Tommy"" Capano, forty-seven, was perhaps the most politically powerful man in Wilmington. Son of a wealthy contractor, former state prosecutor, partner in a prestigious law firm, advisor to governors and mayors, Tom Capano had a soft-spoken and considerate manner that endeared him to many. Although recently estranged from his wife, he was a devoted father to his four beautiful young daughters, the trusted son of his widowed mother, and the backbone of his extended family. But sometime after 9:15 that night when Anne Marie and Tom left a Philadelphia restaurant, something terrible happened to Anne Marie. It would be forty-eight hours before her brothers and sisters realized that she had disappeared entirely., ,Ann Rule brilliantly traces the lives of both Fahey and Capano as she discloses the intimate details of their ill-fated bonding. A vulnerable, trusting woman becomes spellbound by a charming, duplicitous married man, and what begins as a seemingly unremarkable affair is slowly transformed into an obsessive, convoluted, and deadly relationship., ,Through her impeccable research, Rule peels away layer after layer of deception to reveal a man who lived a secret life for decades, a man so greedy that he would sacrifice ,anyone, to gain what he desired. One of his many mistressesâ€”all of whom were unknown to one anotherâ€”was Deborah MacIntyre, an attractive and wealthy member of one of Wilmington's oldest families and an administrator of an elite private school. She, too, would become part of the mystery surrounding Anne Marie's disappearance., ,As three prominent families are destroyed to satisfy one man's jealous obsessions, this unfathomable tragedy becomes a tale that few would believe if it were presented as fiction.

Power Failure: The Inside Story of the Collapse of Enron,"Mimi Swartz,Sherron Watkins","â€œTheyâ€™re still trying to hide the weenie,â€ thought Sherron Watkins as she read a newspaper clipping about Enron two weeks before Christmas, 2001. . . It quoted [CFO] Jeff McMahon addressing the companyâ€™s creditors and cautioning them against a rash judgment. â€œDonâ€™t assume that there is a smoking gun.â€,Sherron knew Enron well enough to know that the company was in extreme spin modeâ€¦,Power Failure, is the electrifying behind-the-scenes story of the collapse of Enron, the high-flying gas and energy company touted as the poster child of the New Economy that, in its hubris, had aspired to be â€œThe Worldâ€™s Leading Company,â€ and had briefly been the seventh largest corporation in America.,Written by prizewinning journalist Mimi Swartz, and substantially based on the never-before-published revelations of former Enron vice-president Sherron Watkins, as well as hundreds of other interviews, ,Power Failure, shows the human face beyond the greed, arrogance, and raw ambition that fueled the companyâ€™s meteoric rise in the late 1990s. At the dawn of the new century, Ken Layâ€™s and Jeff Skilling's faces graced the covers of business magazines, and Enronâ€™s money oiled the political machinery behind George W. Bushâ€™s election campaign. But as Wall Street analysts sang Enronâ€™s praises, and its stock spiraled dizzyingly into the stratosphere, the companyâ€™s leaders were madly scrambling to manufacture illusory profits, hide its ballooning debt, and bully Wall Street into buying its fictional accounting and off-balance-sheet investment vehicles. The story of Enronâ€™s fall is a morality tale writ large, performed on a stage with an unforgettable array of props and side plots, from parking lots overflowing with Boxsters and BMWs to hot-house office affairs and executive tantrums., ,Among the cast of characters Mimi Swartz and Sherron Watkins observe with shrewd Texas eyes and an insiderâ€™s perspective are: CEO Ken Lay, Enronâ€™s â€œoutside face,â€ who was more interested in playing diplomat and paving the road to a political career than in managing Enronâ€™s high-testosterone, anything-goes culture; Jeff Skilling, the mastermind behind Enronâ€™s mercenary trading culture, who transformed himself from a nerdy executive into the personification of millennial cool; Rebecca Mark, the savvy and seductive head of Enronâ€™s international division, who was Skillingâ€™s sole rival to take over the company; and Andy Fastow, whose childish pranks early in his career gave way to something far more destructive. Desperate to be a player in Enronâ€™s deal-making, trader-oriented culture, Fastow transformed Enronâ€™s finance department into a â€œprofit center,â€ creating a honeycomb of financial entities to bolster Enronâ€™s â€œprofits,â€ while diverting tens of millions of dollars into his own pockets,An unprecedented chronicle of Enronâ€™s shocking collapse, ,Power Failure, should take its place alongside the classics of previous decades â€“ ,Barbarians at the Gate, and ,Liarâ€™s Poker, â€“ as one of the cautionary tales of our times.,From the Hardcover edition.",theyre still trying to hide the weenie thought sherron watkins as she read a newspaper clipping about enron two weeks before christmas 2001 it quoted cfo jeff mcmahon addressing the companys creditors and cautioning them against a rash judgment dont assume that there is a smoking gunsherron knew enron well enough to know that the company was in extreme spin modepower failure is the electrifying behindthescenes story of the collapse of enron the highflying gas and energy company touted as the poster child of the new economy that in its hubris had aspired to be the worlds leading company and had briefly been the seventh largest corporation in americawritten by prizewinning journalist mimi swartz and substantially based on the neverbeforepublished revelations of former enron vicepresident sherron watkins as well as hundreds of other interviews power failure shows the human face beyond the greed arrogance and raw ambition that fueled the companys meteoric rise in the late 1990s at the dawn of the new century ken lays and jeff skillings faces graced the covers of business magazines and enrons money oiled the political machinery behind george w bushs election campaign but as wall street analysts sang enrons praises and its stock spiraled dizzyingly into the stratosphere the companys leaders were madly scrambling to manufacture illusory profits hide its ballooning debt and bully wall street into buying its fictional accounting and offbalancesheet investment vehicles the story of enrons fall is a morality tale writ large performed on a stage with an unforgettable array of props and side plots from parking lots overflowing with boxsters and bmws to hothouse office affairs and executive tantrums among the cast of characters mimi swartz and sherron watkins observe with shrewd texas eyes and an insiders perspective are ceo ken lay enrons outside face who was more interested in playing diplomat and paving the road to a political career than in managing enrons hightestosterone anythinggoes culture jeff skilling the mastermind behind enrons mercenary trading culture who transformed himself from a nerdy executive into the personification of millennial cool rebecca mark the savvy and seductive head of enrons international division who was skillings sole rival to take over the company and andy fastow whose childish pranks early in his career gave way to something far more destructive desperate to be a player in enrons dealmaking traderoriented culture fastow transformed enrons finance department into a profit center creating a honeycomb of financial entities to bolster enrons profits while diverting tens of millions of dollars into his own pocketsan unprecedented chronicle of enrons shocking collapse power failure should take its place alongside the classics of previous decades barbarians at the gate and liars poker as one of the cautionary tales of our timesfrom the hardcover edition,"['Business', 'Nonfiction', 'History', 'Economics', 'Finance', 'Economics', 'Crime', 'True Crime', 'Biography', 'Buisness', 'Audiobook']",2919,3.9,290,18,385507879

When a Fan Hits the Shit: The Rise and Fall of a Phony Charity,Jeanine Renne,"Amy Player came from a good family in Virginia. She attended Christopher Newport University for two years and worked at Busch Gardens in the summers. Pretty, bright, and a talented artist, it's hard to understand how she ended up creating a phony charity and fleecing half the cast of the ""Lord of the Rings"" film trilogy. ,In 2002 Ms. Player created an online fan club in homage to actor Sean Astin and his character, Sam Gamgee. This club caught the eye of Abigail Stone, a fan from Oregon, and the women discovered two mutual interests: an obsession with Astin and the other actors, and the willingness to do or say whatever it took to meet them. ,Abbey and Amy developed their fan club into a beautiful, professional-appearing website. They referred to themselves as ""Bit of Earth,"" and claimed that they wanted to raise money ""for charity."" On September 11, 2002, Amy went to Washington, DC and approached Sean Astin after his speech at the Capitol (Mr. Astin sits on the President's Council for Service and Civic Participation). Amy asked him to help out her ""fledgeling charity"" by volunteering with other members to build a Children's Reading Garden for a public library. ,Their planning was perfect. They knew that Astin, having just given a public appeal for active community service, could hardly turn Amy down. They picked those themes because Astin is a staunch advocate for literacy, and gardening would naturally lend itself to publicity for Astin's movie role as gardener Sam Gamgee. As luck would have it, Astin loved the idea of focusing the enthusiasm of LOTR fans toward a charitable community project, instead of the usual autographs and merchandise. He agreed to help build the garden! ,With that kind of endorsement, membership in Bit of Earth rapidly expanded to hundreds of Astin's fans worldwide. All were told that BoE was working in direct association with ""Reading is Fundamental"" to raise funds and build gardens to promote literacy. ,The garden was built in Beaverton, Oregon, in 2003, and Astin's presence gave them renewed international publicity among his fans. Other major LOTR websites covered the news and it seemed that the sky was the limit for Bit of Earth, with its small army of enthusiastic fans working side-by-side with celebrities to improve communities. ,Then it all hit the fan. Amy got caught in a complicated lie, in which she tried to mooch free airline tickets for actors to fly from New Zealand for a Bit of Earth event. This resulted in a miserable trip for several actors. Two of them ended up sleeping on the floor of Amy and Abbey's filthy apartment, instead of the deluxe accomodations they had been promised for attending this ""fundraiser."" ,After the discovery of one lie, hundreds more fell apart. Former Bit of Earth volunteers came forward with horror stories. Amy borrowed a friend's computer and didn't ""log out,"" which gave open access to the official Bit of Earth email account, revealing hundreds of lies that attempted to manipulate celebrities, businesses, volunteers, etc. into supporting this fake charity. ,When A Fan, was written by one of their victims. It takes the reader through the incredible web of firsthand evidence, revealing just how the half-truths, exaggerations, blame games, and other manipulations were employed to swindle both fans and celebrities the world over.

The Fatal Gift of Beauty: The Trials of Amanda Knox,Nina Burleigh,"Â Â Â The sexually violent murder of twenty-one-year-old British student Meredith Kercher in Perugia, Italy, on the night of November 1, 2007, became an international sensation when one of Kercherâ€™s housemates, twenty-year-old Seattle native Amanda Knox, as well as her Italian boyfriend and a troubled local man Knox said she â€œvaguelyâ€ knew, was arrested and charged with the murder. The Fatal Gift of Beauty is award-winning author and journalist Nina Burleighâ€™s mesmerizing literary investigation of the murder, the controversial prosecution, the conviction and twenty-six-year sentence of Knox, the machinations of Italian justice, and the underground depravity and clash of cultures in one of central -Italyâ€™s most beloved cities.,Â Â Â Â Â  When Perugia authorities concluded that the murder was part of a dark, twisted riteâ€”a â€œsex gameâ€â€”led by the American with an uncanny resemblance to Perugiaâ€™s Madonna, they unleashed a media frenzy from Rome to London to New York and Seattle. The story drew an international cult obsessed with â€œFoxy Knoxy,â€ a pretty honor student on a junior year abroad, who either woke up one morning into a nightmare of superstition and misogynyâ€”the dark side of Italyâ€”or participated in something unspeakable.,Â Â Â Â Â  The investigation begins in the old stone cottage overlooking bucolic olive groves where Kercherâ€™s body was found in her locked bedroom. It winds through the shadowy, arched alleys of Perugia, a city of art that is also a magnet for tens of thousands of students who frequent its bars, clubs, and drug bazaar on the steps of the Duomo. It climaxes in an up-close account of Italyâ€™s dysfunctional legal system, as the trial slowly unfolds at the townâ€™s Tribunale, and the prosecutionâ€™s thunderous final appeal to God before the quivering girl defendant resembles a scene from the Inquisition.Â ,Â Â Â Â Â  To reveal what actually happened on that terrible night after Halloween, Nina Burleigh lived in Perugia, attended the trial, and corresponded with the incarcerated defendants.

The Rhythm Section,Mark Burnell,"The debut of an extraordinary new author â€“ a novel of how a woman, pushed over the edge by the violent deaths of her family, survives only by taking other identities.,Stephanie Patrickâ€™s world was destroyed by the Atlantic aircrash. Falling into a downward spiral of prostitution, drugs and drink, she is picked up by a journalist who has discovered that it was a bomb that caused the crash. And it is his murder that pulls her out of herself.,The Rhythm Section is not a thriller about the hunt for a terrorist, although that is the path Stephanie takes, and itâ€™s not a story about revenge, although justice for her family is her initial motivation. Rather, The Rhythm Section is the story of Stephanieâ€™s attempt to reclaim herself. She has to rediscover who she is through a series of roles that she is forced to play; she is never herself. As a prostitute, she is Lisa, the chemical blonde. Later, she is Petra Reuter, German anarchist turned mercenary terrorist. Sometimes, she is Marina Gaudenzi, a Swiss businesswoman, or sheâ€™s Susan Branch, an American student, or Elizabeth Shepherd, an English management consultant.,But whoever she is, sheâ€™s never herself because her life depends on her being someone else.

This undermines her completely and poses new questions: which of the many people she has become is the one to have fallen in love? Stephanie? Petra? Or one of the others?

A dogtag beside it in the earth bears the name Ben Gordheimer, a young American soldier who disappearedâ€”and was dishonorably discharged for desertionâ€”during the war fifty years before. To complicate matters for the police team of Keith Tyrell, the adept and ambitious Detective Inspector sent to Tolland, the investigation into the G.I.'s death unearths a second, much more recent corpse whose identity and identification as a blackmailer sets the entire village even more on edge. While Tyrell discovers the killer, long dead, of the G.I. quickly enough, the village of Tolland itself proves to be a harder case to crack. The repercussions of the old murder continue to haunt the memories and disturb the souls of Tolland's inhabitants, while the fact that another killer is dwelling in their midst troubles the placidity of their closely knit daily lives. Their distrust of Tyrell's inquiry and of the avid press only reinforces their tight-lipped secrecy. Tyrell has problems of his own as well, with the envy and betrayals of internal politics among the members of his police team increasingly impeding the progress of the investigation.

Spotted Hemlock,Gladys Mitchell,"When two male students execute a rag against the nearby Calladale women's agricultural college--a prank involving rhubarb and dead rats--the ladies decide to give the men back some of their own. They collect the litter and sneak it over to a pub which happens to be a favorite with the men.

Dame Beatrice finds the story most interesting, and other facts soon emerge: Norah Palliser was secretly married to a penniless painter named Coles; she may have been connected with Carey's predecessor, a man with questionable morals nicknamed by the students as ""Piggy"" Basil; and petty thefts have been occuring within the college.,The coroner reports death by coniine poisoning, probably extracted from the root of spotted hemlock; there's also the puzzling fact that the victim is physically older than Norah Palliser's twenty-three years.

Stories from Jonestown,Leigh Fondakowski,"The saga of Jonestown didnâ€™t end on the day in November 1978 when more than nine hundred Americans died in a mass murder-suicide in the Guyanese jungle. While only a handful of people present at the agricultural project survived that day in Jonestown, more than eighty members of Peoples Temple, led by Jim Jones, were elsewhere in Guyana on that day, and thousands more members of the movement still lived in California. Emmy-nominated writer Leigh Fondakowski, who is best known for her work on the play and HBO film ,The Laramie Project,, spent three years traveling the United States to interview these survivors, many of whom have never talked publicly about the tragedy. Using more than two hundred hours of interview material, Fondakowski creates intimate portraits of these survivors as they tell their unforgettable stories.,Collectively this is a record of ordinary people, stigmatized as cultists, who after the Jonestown massacre were left to deal with their grief, reassemble their lives, and try to make sense of how a movement born in a gospel of racial and social justice could have gone so horrifically wrongâ€”taking with it the lives of their sons and daughters, husbands and wives, fathers and mothers, and brothers and sisters. As these survivors look back, we learn what led them to join the Peoples Temple movement, what life in the church was like, and how the trauma of Jonestownâ€™s end still affects their lives decades later.,What emerges are portrayals both haunting and hopefulâ€”of unimaginable sadness, guilt, and shame but also resilience and redemption. Weaving her own artistic journey of discovery throughout the book in a compelling historical context, Fondakowski delivers, with both empathy and clarity, one of the most gripping, moving, and humanizing accounts of Jonestown ever written.",the saga of jonestown didnt end on the day in november 1978 when more than nine hundred americans died in a mass murdersuicide in the guyanese jungle while only a handful of people present at the agricultural project survived that day in jonestown more than eighty members of peoples temple led by jim jones were elsewhere in guyana on that day and thousands more members of the movement still lived in california emmynominated writer leigh fondakowski who is best known for her work on the play and hbo film the laramie project spent three years traveling the united states to interview these survivors many of whom have never talked publicly about the tragedy using more than two hundred hours of interview material fondakowski creates intimate portraits of these survivors as they tell their unforgettable storiescollectively this is a record of ordinary people stigmatized as cultists who after the jonestown massacre were left to deal with their grief reassemble their lives and try to make sense of how a movement born in a gospel of racial and social justice could have gone so horrifically wrongtaking with it the lives of their sons and daughters husbands and wives fathers and mothers and brothers and sisters as these survivors look back we learn what led them to join the peoples temple movement what life in the church was like and how the trauma of jonestowns end still affects their lives decades laterwhat emerges are portrayals both haunting and hopefulof unimaginable sadness guilt and shame but also resilience and redemption weaving her own artistic journey of discovery throughout the book in a compelling historical context fondakowski delivers with both empathy and clarity one of the most gripping moving and humanizing accounts of jonestown ever written,"['Nonfiction', 'History', 'Crime', 'True Crime', 'Religion', 'Cults', 'Religion', 'Autobiography', 'Memoir', 'Mystery', 'Crime', 'Biography Memoir', 'Biography', 'Classics', 'Cult Classics']",1778,4.04,520,92,816678081

The First Day,Marc Levy,"A mysterious object found in a dormant volcano will forever change the lives of Adrian and Keira. Together they embark on an extraordinary adventure which takes them from the banks of Lake Turkana in the heart of Africa to the mountains of China. They seek to reveal the object's hidden secrets and answer the age-old question: how did life begin?,Keira is a passionate and ambitious archaeologist leading her first dig in the isolated Omo Valley in Ethiopia. When a sand storm destroys the site, she has no choice but to abandon her field work and go home: to Paris, to her sister and to the mundane city life she despises. She returns with an unusual stone, which was given to her by a local orphan boy. While visiting the museum where her sister works, a probing elderly professor takes a particular interest in Keira and above all in the talisman she wears around her neck. ,Adrian is an accomplished astrophysicist, who has taken a leave of absence from the illustrious Academy of Sciences in London to pursue his study of the stars in a remote observatory on the Atacama plateau in Chile. Ill-adapted to the altitude, he has to be rushed back to England before he can fully pursue his bold and unconventional research. ,Keira and Adrian's paths briefly cross while competing for an illustrious grant in London. Years earlier they had spent one brief, romantic summer together before going their separate ways. Keira leaves her necklace behind in Adrian's apartment, sparking his interest as a scientist and fuelling his hopes for a rekindling of old passions. With the help of a hapless administrator from the Academy, Adrian begins his own investigation of the stone's origins, but it quickly becomes apparent that he is not the only one interested in the mysterious object, and that the other party is determined to get hold of it at any cost. ,Adrian seeks out Keira who has returned to Africa. What innocently begins as a common pursuit of knowledge soon takes a dangerous turn when their guide is found dead. Despite heightening threats to their own safety, Keira and Adrian continue their search, which takes them across the world, from cutting edge laboratories to venerable museums, from forgotten Greek islands to monasteries hidden in the mountains. They follow maps written in the stars and clues buried within the earth, always guided by the slowly unraveling secrets of the strange object from Ethiopia.

Crime of Privilege,Walter Walker,"In the tradition of Scott Turow, William Landay, and Nelson DeMille, ""Crime of Privilege"" is a stunning thriller about power, corruption, and the law in America--and the dangerous ways they come together. , A murder on Cape Cod. A rape in Palm Beach. , All they have in common is the presence of one of America's most beloved and influential families. But nobody is asking questions. Not the police. Not the prosecutors. And certainly not George Becket, a young lawyer toiling away in the basement of the Cape & Islands district attorney's office. George has always lived at the edge of power. He wasn't born to privilege, but he understands how it works and has benefitted from it in ways he doesn't like to admit. Now, an investigation brings him deep inside the world of the truly wealthy--and shows him what a perilous place it is. , Years have passed since a young woman was found brutally slain at an exclusive Cape Cod golf club, and no one has ever been charged. Cornered by the victim's father, George can't explain why certain leads were never explored--leads that point in the direction of a single family--and he agrees to look into it. , What begins as a search through the highly stratified layers of Cape Cod society, soon has George racing from Idaho to Hawaii, Costa Rica to France to New York City. But everywhere he goes he discovers people like himself: people with more secrets than answers, people haunted by a decision years past to trade silence for protection from life's sharp edges. George finds his friends are not necessarily still friends and a spouse can be unfaithful in more ways than one. And despite threats at every turn, he is driven to reconstruct the victim's last hours while searching not only for a killer but for his own redemption. ,Advance praise for ""Crime of Privilege"" ,""Fans of John Grisham and Scott Turow especially will love this engrossing story of murder involving high society. The author's wit, dry and cutting, is razor-sharp and somewhat reminiscent of Nelson DeMille's John Corey. . . .

"Dr. Feelgood: The Story of the Doctor Who Influenced History by Treating and Drugging Prominent Figures Including President Kennedy, Marilyn Monroe, and Elvis Presley","Richard A. Lertzman,William J. Birnes","Doctor Max Jacobson, whom the Secret Service under President John F. Kennedy code-named ""Dr. Feelgood,"" developed a unique ""energy formula"" that altered the paths of some of the twentieth century's most iconic figures, including President and Jackie Kennedy, Marilyn Monroe, Frank Sinatra, and Elvis. JFK received his first injection (a special mix of ""vitamins and hormones,"" according to Jacobson) just before his first debate with Vice President Richard Nixon. The shot into JFK's throat not only cured his laryngitis, but also diminished the pain in his back, allowed him to stand up straighter, and invigorated the tired candidate. Kennedy demolished Nixon in that first debate and turned a tide of skepticism about Kennedy into an audience that appreciated his energy and crispness. What JFK didn't know then was that the injections were actually powerful doses of a combination of highly addictive liquid methamphetamine and steroids.Author and researcher Rick Lertzman and New York Times bestselling author Bill Birnes reveal heretofore unpublished material about the mysterious Dr. Feelgood. Through well-researched prose and interviews with celebrities including George Clooney, Jerry Lewis, Yogi Berra, and Sid Caesar, the authors reveal Jacobson's vast influence on events such as the assassination of JFK, the Cuban Missile Crisis, the Kennedy-Khrushchev Vienna Summit, the murder of Marilyn Monroe, the filming of the C. B. DeMille classic The Ten Commandments, and the work of many of the great artists of that era.

The Chinatown War: Chinese Los Angeles and the Massacre of 1871,Scott Zesch,"In October 1871, a simmering, small-scale turf war involving three Chinese gangs exploded into a riot that engulfed the small but growing town of Los Angeles. A large mob of white Angelenos, spurred by racial resentment, rampaged through the city and lynched some 18 people before order was restored.,In ,The Chinatown War,, Scott Zesch offers a compelling account of this little-known event, which ranks among the worst hate crimes in American history. The story begins in the 1850s, when the first wave of Chinese immigrants arrived in Los Angeles in the wake of the 1849 California gold rush. Upon arrival, these immigrants usually took up low-wage jobs, settled in the slum neighborhood of the Calle de los Negros, and joined one of a number of Chinese community associations. Though such associations provided job placement and other services to their members, they were also involved in extortion and illicit businesses, including prostitution. In 1870 the largest of these, the See-Yup Company, imploded in an acrimonious division. The violent succession battle that ensued, as well as the highly publicized torture of Chinese prostitute Sing-Ye, eventually provided the spark for the racially motivated riot that ripped through L.A. Zesch vividly evokes the figures and events in the See-Yup dispute, deftly situates the riot within its historical and political context, and illuminates the workings of the early Chinese-American community in Los Angeles, while simultaneously exploring issues that continue to trouble Americans today.,Engaging and deeply researched, ,The Chinatown War, above all delivers a riveting story of a dominant American city and the darker side of its early days that offers powerful insights for our own time.",in october 1871 a simmering smallscale turf war involving three chinese gangs exploded into a riot that engulfed the small but growing town of los angeles a large mob of white angelenos spurred by racial resentment rampaged through the city and lynched some 18 people before order was restoredin the chinatown war scott zesch offers a compelling account of this littleknown event which ranks among the worst hate crimes in american history the story begins in the 1850s when the first wave of chinese immigrants arrived in los angeles in the wake of the 1849 california gold rush upon arrival these immigrants usually took up lowwage jobs settled in the slum neighborhood of the calle de los negros and joined one of a number of chinese community associations though such associations provided job placement and other services to their members they were also involved in extortion and illicit businesses including prostitution in 1870 the largest of these the seeyup company imploded in an acrimonious division the violent succession battle that ensued as well as the highly publicized torture of chinese prostitute singye eventually provided the spark for the racially motivated riot that ripped through la zesch vividly evokes the figures and events in the seeyup dispute deftly situates the riot within its historical and political context and illuminates the workings of the early chineseamerican community in los angeles while simultaneously exploring issues that continue to trouble americans todayengaging and deeply researched the chinatown war above all delivers a riveting story of a dominant american city and the darker side of its early days that offers powerful insights for our own time,"['History', 'Nonfiction', 'Cultural', 'China', 'North American Hi...', 'American History', 'Crime', 'True Crime']",1701,4.02,45,10,019975876X

Spymistress: The True Story of the Greatest Female Secret Agent of World War II,William Stevenson,"
  ,She was beautiful. She was ruthless. She had a steel trap for a mind and a will of iron. Born Vera Maria Rosenberg in Bucharest, she became Vera Atkins, legendary spy and holder of the Legion of Honor. Recruited by William Stevensonâ€”the spymaster who would later come to be known as â€œIntrepidâ€â€”when she was only twenty-three, Vera spent much of the 1930s running countless perilous espionage missions. When war was declared in 1939, her fierce intelligence, blunt manner, personal courage, and knowledge of several languages quickly propelled her to the leadership echelon of the highly secretive Special Operations Executive (SOE), a covert intelligence agency formed by, and reporting to, Winston Churchill. She recruited and trained several hundred agents, including dozens of women, whose objectives were to penetrate deep behind enemy lines.,
  ,The stirring exploits and the exemplary courage of the SOE agents and the French Resistance fightersâ€”who in the words of General Dwight D. Eisenhower together â€œshortened the war by many monthsâ€â€”are justly celebrated. But the central role of Vera Atkins has until now been cloaked in silence. William Stevenson was the only person she trusted to record her life; he kept his promise that he would not publish her story until after her death. Here is the extraordinary account of the woman whose intelligence, beauty, and unflagging dedication proved key in turning the tide of World War II.,

A Summer of Drowning,John Burnside,"A terrifying and dream-like new novel from one of our greatest contemporary writers.,Â ,At a critical point in her career, painter Angelika Rossdal suddenly moves to Kvaloya, a small island deep in the Arctic Circle, to dedicate herself to the solitary pursuit of her craft. With her, she brings her young daughter, Liv, who grows up isolated and unable or unwilling to make friends her own age, spending much of her time alone, or with an elderly neighbour, Kyrre Jonsson, who beguiles her with old folk tales and stories about trolls, mermaids and -- crucially for the events that unfold in the summer of her eighteenth year -- about the ,huldra,, a wild spirit who appears in the form of an irresistibly beautiful girl, to lure young men to their doom.,Â ,Now twenty-eight, Liv looks back on her life and particularly to that summer when two boys drowned under mysterious circumstances in the still moonlit waters off the shores of Kvaloya. Were the deaths accidental, or were the boys, as Kyrre believes, lured to their deaths by a malevolent spirit? To begin with, Liv dismisses the old man's stories as fantasy, but as the summer continues and events take an even darker turn, she comes to believe that something supernatural is happening on the island. But is it? Or is Liv, a lonely girl who has spent her entire life in the shadow of her beautiful, gifted mother, slowly beginning to lose touch with reality?,Â ,Set in the white nights of an Arctic summer, the novel has the heightened, hallucinogenic atmosphere of a dream, but culminates in a moment of profound horror.

The Whitechapel Horrors,Edward B. Hanna,"Edward B. Hanna brings Sherlock Holmes stunningly back to life in this homage to Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's great creation. The Whitechapel Horrors, with its spellbinding story and atmospheric prose, is the best new Holmes adventure since Seven-Per-Cent Solution. Here Hanna imagines the characters anew, while maintaining the integrity of Conan Doyle's originals. Grotesque murders are being committed on the streets of Whitechapel. Sherlock Holmes comes to believe the murders are the skillful work of one man, a man who earns the gruesome epithet of Jack the Ripper. As the investigation proceeds, Holmes realizes that the true identity of the Ripper puts much more at stake than merely catching a killer - the most fundamental British institutions may very well be threatened. He is faced with the most difficult decision he has ever made, a crisis of conscience that shakes him to his very core. Holmes must decide where his allegiance truly lies - with his code of honor as a detective and champion of justice, or with his strong feelings of patriotism and love of England. Hanna vividly evokes the atmosphere of Victorian London in all its great and sordid details: the gaslight lamps and hansom cabs, the rain in the streets, the smell of poverty, the people and their language, dress, and habits. The Whitechapel Horrors is vintage Holmes, a ripping good mystery worthy of the great detective and his eminent creator.

Jesus Freaks: A True Story of Murder and Madness on the Evangelical Edge,Don Lattin,"In the tradition of Jon Krakauer's ,Under the Banner of Heaven,, Don Lattin's ,Jesus Freaks, is the story of a shocking pilgrimage of revenge that left two people dead and shed new light on The Family International, one of the most controversial religious movements to emerge from the spiritual turmoil of the sixties and seventies.,Some say The Family Internationalâ€”previously known as the Children of Godâ€”began with the best intentions. But their sexual and spiritual excesses soon forced them to go underground and follow a dark and dangerous path.

Letters sent surreptitiously from a mailbox in New Jersey to media and political figures in New York, Florida, and Washington D.C. killed five people and infected seventeen others. For years, the case remained officially unsolvedâ€”and it consumed the FBI and became a rallying point for launching the Iraq War. Far from Baghdad, at Fort Detrick, Maryland, stood Bruce Ivins: an accomplished microbiologist at work on patenting a next-generation anthrax vaccine. Ivins, it turned out, also was a man the FBI consulted frequently to learn the science behind the attacks.,The Mirage Man, reveals how this seemingly harmless if eccentric scientist hid a sinister secret life from his closest associates and family, and how the trail of genetic and circumstantial evidence led inexorably to him. Along the way, Willman exposes the faulty investigative work that led to the public smearing of the wrong man, Steven Hatfill, a scientist specializing in biowarfare preparedness whose life was upended by media stakeouts and op-ed-page witch hunts.Â ,Engrossing and unsparing, ,The Mirage Man, is a portrait of a deeply troubled scientist who for more than twenty years had unlimited access to the U.S. Armyâ€™s stocks of deadly anthrax. It is also the story of a struggle for control within the FBI investigation, the missteps of an overzealous press, and how a cadre of government officials disregarded scientific data while spinning the letter attacks into a basis for war.
